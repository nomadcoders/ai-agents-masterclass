      "The Battle of Waterloo, fought on 18 June 1815 near the village of Waterloo in present-day Belgium, was the climactic defeat that ended Napoleon Bonaparte’s rule and the Napoleonic Wars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Context\n",
      "- After escaping exile on Elba in March 1815, Napoleon reclaimed power in France (the “Hundred Days”). The Seventh Coalition—Britain, Prussia, Austria, Russia and others—mobilized to topple him again.\n",
      "- Napoleon moved quickly into Belgium to defeat the Coalition armies piecemeal before they could fully unite.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opposing forces and commanders\n",
      "- France: Napoleon Bonaparte, with about 72,000 men (notably Marshals Ney and Grouchy).\n",
      "- Anglo-Allied army: the Duke of Wellington, roughly 68,000 troops, a multinational force (British, Dutch-Belgian, Hanoverian, Brunswick, Nassau, King’s German Legion).\n",
      "- Prussia: Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, whose army (over 50,000 available; fewer initially engaged) was marching to join Wellington.\n",
      "\n",
      "Course of the battle\n",
      "- Morning: Heavy rain the night before left muddy ground, delaying Napoleon’s attack until late morning. The French opened with an assault on Hougoumont, a fortified farm, which became a costly, day-long struggle that tied down French troops.\n",
      "- Midday: A large French infantry attack (d’Erlon’s I Corps) on Wellington’s left-center was repelled by steadfast infantry and a dramatic countercharge by British heavy cavalry.\n",
      "- Afternoon: The French captured La Haye Sainte, a key farm in the center, threatening Wellington’s line. Marshal Ney launched massed cavalry charges against Allied infantry squares but, without adequate infantry and artillery support, failed to break them.\n",
      "- Prussian arrival: Beginning mid-to-late afternoon, Blücher’s forces (Bülow’s IV Corps) struck the French right near Plancenoit; more Prussian corps arrived steadily, stretching Napoleon’s line.\n",
      "- Climax: Near evening, Napoleon committed elements of the Imperial Guard to pierce Wellington’s center. The Guard’s attack was repulsed by Allied infantry. As Prussians pressed harder and Wellington ordered a general advance, the French army broke. Some Guard units formed squares and withdrew in order, but the wider army routed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Casualties and result\n",
      "- French casualties were roughly 24,000–29,000 killed and wounded, with thousands more captured; Allied losses around 15,000; Prussians about 7,000 (estimates vary).\n",
      "- Napoleon retreated to Paris, abdicated on 22 June, and was exiled to Saint Helena. The Bourbon monarchy was restored. Waterloo ended the Hundred Days and confirmed the Vienna settlement shaping Europe’s postwar order.\n",
      "\n",
      "Significance and legacy\n",
      "- Waterloo cemented Britain and Prussia as key continental powers and ushered in a relatively stable European balance (the “Concert of Europe”).\n",
      "- Tactically, it showcased Wellington’s defensive positioning (notably reverse-slope tactics) and the decisive impact of timely coalition coordination.\n",
      "- The battle entered cultural memory with phrases like Wellington’s “the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life” and legends surrounding the Imperial Guard’s last stand.\n",

      "Alexander the Great (Alexander III of Macedon, 356–323 BCE) was the king of Macedon who, after succeeding his father Philip II in 336 BCE, conquered the Achaemenid Persian Empire and campaigned from Greece and Egypt to as far as the Indus Valley, creating one of the largest empires of the ancient world. Tutored by Aristotle, he was a brilliant commander who never lost a battle, winning decisive victories at Issus and Gaugamela. He founded numerous cities—most famously Alexandria in Egypt—and spread Greek (Hellenic) culture across the Near East, shaping the Hellenistic world. Alexander died in Babylon at age 32, and his empire soon fragmented among his generals (the Diadochi), but his cultural and political legacy endured for centuries.\n",
