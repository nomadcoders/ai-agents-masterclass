- **Ask Smart Questions:** Probe their technical challenges and roadmap to show genuine interest and strategic thinking.  

Red Flags to Watch For  
- **Unclear Onboarding:** If there’s no structured migration plan for Go newcomers, ask how they support skill transitions.  
- **Team Overload:** Watch for signs of chronic overtime or lack of DevOps support—ask about on-call rotations.  
- **Lack of Metrics:** Ensure they have clear performance and reliability SLAs, not just aspirational goals.  

Good luck—you have the foundation, now bring your enthusiasm, examples, and strategic curiosity to every answer!
