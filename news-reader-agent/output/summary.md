### 📖 Comprehensive Summary  
**Context & Background**  
After five days of intense clashes near the disputed Preah Vihear temple—leaving at least 37 dead and displacing some 300,000—Cambodia and Thailand escalated from battlefield de-escalation to formal, Malaysia-hosted talks. Relations had frayed since May’s fatal shooting of a Cambodian soldier, compounded by June landmine incidents damaging Thai convoys.

**Talks Under Malaysian Auspices**  
On August 4, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim convened the first of several technical sessions in Kuala Lumpur. Malaysia’s Chief of Defence Forces, Gen. Mohamad Nizam Jaffar, oversees logistics alongside ASEAN envoys, with US and Chinese observers present. Cambodia’s Defense Minister Tea Seih and Thailand’s Deputy Defense Minister Gen. Natthaphon Nakpanit co-chair the dialogue.

**Key Agenda & Commitments**  
- Ceasefire enforcement: Joint patrols, hotlines, and incident-verification protocols.  
- Prisoner releases: Framework for swift repatriation amid Cambodian claims of mistreatment and Thai POW status.  
- Displaced civilians: UN-led plans to return 300,000 people, clear minefields, and rebuild infrastructure.  
- Humanitarian access: Demilitarized corridors for aid delivery and restoration of essential services.

**Perspectives & Risks**  
Thai PM Srettha Thavisin hailed the talks as “a critical step towards lasting peace,” while Hun Sen, backed by a royal decree, vowed to defend Cambodia’s territorial integrity. Analysts warn that without robust trust measures, sporadic shelling may resume. Human Rights Watch highlights the urgency of clearing unexploded ordnance to safeguard civilians.

**Outlook**  
Three more committee sessions will refine technical protocols. Success could bolster ASEAN’s mediation role, stabilise bilateral ties, and ease US-China strategic competition in Southeast Asia. Failure risks a rapid return to hostilities and deeper regional fissures.

### 📋 Executive Summary  
In the first formal engagement since their July 28 ceasefire, Thai and Cambodian officials met in Malaysia August 4 to draft protocols under the ASEAN-brokered truce that halted five days of fierce fighting along their contested border. The four-day General Border Committee talks, previously slated in Cambodia, are now in Kuala Lumpur to ensure neutrality. Key focuses include preventing flare-ups, detailing humanitarian corridors, addressing unexploded ordnance and landmine dangers, and finalizing a joint monitoring framework. Malaysia’s military chief, Gen. Mohamad Nizam Jaffar, underscored both sides’ commitment despite sporadic skirmishes. Observers from the US and China join ASEAN monitors. Economic incentives from a US tariff cut have bolstered diplomatic momentum. Cambodia announced a royal decree empowering former PM Hun Sen in defense roles, underscoring heightened stakes. Successful negotiations could herald a blueprint for ASEAN conflict resolution, while breakdown risks reigniting hostilities and deepening regional fractures.

### 📖 Comprehensive Summary  
**Background**  
On July 28, after five days of heavy artillery and ground clashes near Preah Vihear, Cambodia and Thailand agreed to a shaky ceasefire mediated by Malaysia, the incoming ASEAN chair. The conflict sprang from a long-running territorial dispute rooted in a 1962 ICJ ruling and aggravated by recent landmine incidents.

**Venue & Stakes**  
Initially scheduled for Phnom Penh, the four-day General Border Committee convened in Kuala Lumpur to leverage Malaysia’s neutrality. The meetings aim to convert local commanders’ stop-fire understandings into a formal treaty backed by ASEAN.

**Agenda Items**  
- **Ceasefire safeguards:** Hotlines, verification procedures, joint patrols.  
- **Humanitarian access & displaced:** Plans for 260,000+ civilians’ return, UNHCR-led registration, mine clearance.  
- **Prisoner treatment:** Cambodia demands “immediate and unconditional” returns; Thailand holds them as POWs until conflict resolution. ICRC/OHCHR inspections invited.  
- **Monitoring mechanism:** ASEAN-led team with US/China observers to ensure impartial oversight.

**Political Dynamics**  
Cambodia’s king authorized Hun Sen’s enhanced military role amid nationalist pressures. Thailand’s PM Srettha Thavisin prioritizes stability to resume trade talks. US President Trump’s tariff warnings—and subsequent reductions—have motivated both sides to sustain the ceasefire.

**Expert and Local Views**  
Security analysts warn that without rigorous landmine clearance, civilian returns are perilous. Sisaket villagers recount fear of renewed shelling. Humanitarian groups note rising mental-health needs among displaced families.

**Prospects**  
By Thursday’s plenary, delegates will publish reference protocols for ASEAN updates. A successful outcome could strengthen ASEAN’s crisis management toolkit; failure may rekindle cross-border skirmishes and hamper regional integration.

Cambodia & Thailand ink an “immediate and unconditional” ceasefire, halting cross-border shelling near Preah Vihear temple. Agreement includes detainee swaps, joint monitoring and civilian access restoration under Malaysia’s ASEAN-led mediation. #PeaceDeal #ASEAN

### 📋 Executive Summary  
After five days of heavy clashes that killed 40+ and displaced over 350,000, Cambodia and Thailand have formalized an “immediate and unconditional” ceasefire in Kuala Lumpur, brokered by Malaysian PM Anwar Ibrahim. The accord mandates suspension of artillery fire, establishment of a joint civilian and military monitoring group, and release of all detainees. It also calls for reopening roads and humanitarian corridors in the disputed Preah Vihear temple area, with ASEAN’s incoming chair Malaysia as custodian. Both parties agreed to fortnightly updates to ASEAN foreign ministers and invited UN and ICRC observers. Regional analysts view the deal as a pivotal test for ASEAN’s conflict-resolution credibility, noting that long-standing mistrust and previous flare-ups underscore the need for robust verification measures to secure a durable peace.

### 📖 Comprehensive Summary  
**Historical Context**  
The Preah Vihear temple has symbolized Thai-Cambodian tensions since a 1962 ICJ ruling assigned the site to Cambodia. Sporadic skirmishes erupted again in May after a Cambodian soldier’s death, culminating in late July’s deadly firefights.

**Ceasefire Terms**  
Under Malaysia’s mediation, both sides agreed to:  
- Suspend all armed engagement, including artillery and mortars.  
- Release detainees within 72 hours, with ICRC oversight.  
- Create a joint monitoring committee—military, civilian and ASEAN observers—to investigate violations.  
- Demilitarize a 5 km buffer zone around Preah Vihear, based on agreed maps.  
- Reopen border crossings for civilians and aid, managed by ASEAN field offices.

**Role of ASEAN**  
As ASEAN chair, Malaysia facilitated shuttle diplomacy. PM Anwar Ibrahim hosted a palace luncheon where Cambodian Deputy PM Tea Seih and Thai Deputy Defence Minister Natthaphon Nakpanit signed the deal. ASEAN foreign ministers will receive biweekly progress reports—an unprecedented direct follow-up mechanism.

**Regional & International Implications**  
- **ASEAN unity:** Tests the bloc’s capacity to mediate intra-member conflicts ahead of its 60th anniversary summit.  
- **Great Power dynamics:** The US hailed the accord as a triumph for diplomacy; China offered technical support for monitoring systems, avoiding overt political statements.  
- **Humanitarian relief:** UN agencies pre-positioned relief stocks; Mines Advisory Group to coordinate ordnance clearance with both armies.

**Challenges Ahead**  
Analysts caution that deep-seated mistrust, exacerbated by recent propaganda campaigns, may undermine compliance. Remote terrain and patchy communications could hamper monitoring. Successful implementation hinges on both sides resisting nationalist pressures and demonstrating transparency.

**Future Outlook**  
If honoured, the ceasefire could stabilize the border, revive cross-border trade and cement ASEAN’s reputation as an effective mediator. Conversely, any high-profile violation risks reigniting hostilities, eroding ASEAN’s credibility and unsettling regional security.
