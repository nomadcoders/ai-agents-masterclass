The decision comes amid a moderation in economic activity, with GDP growth slowing and job gains declining, while inflation expectations are still aligned with the Federal Reserve's longer-term goal of 2%. The committee is committed to maintaining its independence and is focused on balancing its dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices, acknowledging a complex economic environment influenced by factors like tariffs and the changing supply and demand for labor.\"}} \n",

      "{'get_recommendation': {'recommendation': \"Based on the document, the following are three recommended next steps for the Federal Reserve:\\n\\n1. **Continue Data-Driven Decision-Making**: The Federal Reserve should maintain its commitment to adjusting monetary policy based on incoming economic data, the evolving economic outlook, and risks to both employment and inflation. This involves closely monitoring trends in unemployment, wage growth, inflation, and key economic indicators to inform future policy actions.\\n\\n2. **Evaluate and Manage Inflation Risks**: With inflation remaining somewhat elevated and goods inflation contributing to price increases, it is crucial for the Fed to assess whether inflationary pressures might be more persistent than anticipated. This includes considering the impact of tariffs and other external factors on inflation. The Fed should continue to ensure that a one-time increase in price levels does not translate into ongoing inflation issues.\\n\\n3. **Balance Dual Mandate Goals**: As the Fed aims to achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices, it should continue to balance the downside risks to employment with the upside risks to inflation. Given the current economic environment, the Fed may need to maintain a neutral policy stance that allows it to respond flexibly and timely to shifts in the economic landscape. This includes keeping an eye on both interest rates and the size of the Fed's balance sheet as tools to promote these goals.\"}} \n",

They also decided to continue reducing securities holdings, reflecting a shift toward a more neutral policy stance in response to changing economic conditions.\\n\\n2. **Economic Activity and Inflation**: Economic activity growth has moderated, with the GDP rising at about 1.5% in the first half of the year, down from 2.5% the previous year. Inflation remains somewhat elevated, with consumer price index readings indicating higher inflation for goods, while disinflation trends are observed in services.\\n\\n3. **Labor Market Conditions**: Although the unemployment rate remains relatively low at 4.3%, job gains have slowed significantly, averaging just 29,000 per month over the past three months. Factors such as declining labor force growth due to lower immigration and participation are contributing to a softer labor market.\\n\\n4. **Risks to Economic Outlook**: There are downside risks to employment and upside risks to inflation. Uncertainties related to tariffs, government policy changes, and their impacts on the economy persist, requiring careful management to avoid more persistent inflationary pressures.\\n\\n5. **Fed's Commitment and Goals**: The Federal Reserve remains committed to its dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices.
