(Photo: D. Calma/IAEA)There is growing global interest in nuclear energy, and countries are acting on this interest. In the opening session of the Scientific Forum, the President of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo, shared his plans for the inclusion of nuclear energy in the country’s electricity generation mix. “We’re committed to a clean, equitable energy transition that harnesses the full potential of all low carbon sources, including nuclear power,” President Akufo-Addo said. “Nuclear power will play a significant part in this transformation.”\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Ghana is analysing small modular reactors (SMRs) and their potential for rapid deployment for clean and affordable energy. “We are working with industry experts to study the feasibility of deploying this new technology in Ghana,” President Akufo-Addo said.\\\\xa0In the United States of America, where nuclear power provides the single largest source of clean energy, “reaching our 2050 net zero goals depends on at least tripling our nuclear energy capacity to 300 gigawatts or more,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm. The US Government has invested “billions of dollars in the future of nuclear energy, creating historic tax incentives for investments in new facilities and production of nuclear energy,” and the development of a domestic fuel supply chain is underway, she added\\\\xa0\\\\xa0The US Department of Energy recently released , a set of reports to accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies, including advanced nuclear reactors. Advanced reactors are key to reaching net zero goals because they can help to decarbonize energy intensive industries, such as hydrogen production, desalination, district heating, petroleum refining and fertilizer production, Secretary Granholm said. She encouraged more countries to look at nuclear energy as a sustainable, long term investment and to harness “the power of the atom for a new era of peace and prosperity in what is potentially the greatest peace project of our time – a net zero world.”\\\\xa0The Republic of Korea is also investing in growing its nuclear sector. Since 2000, Korea has been implementing its Nuclear Power System Development Plan, with a specific focus on developing advanced reactors, and as a result, in 2012, Korea’s first SMR – SMART – received the standard design approval from the Korean regulator, said Lee Jong-Ho, Minister of Science and ICT in the Republic of Korea. “Now we are developing an even more advanced and innovative SMR based on SMART technology,” he added.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0The Korean Government believes that the private sector should take the lead in technological innovations. “This is especially true for the SMR sector, which aims to replace fossil fuels in industries such as seawater desalination and space exploration,” Minister Jong-Ho said. The Korean Government is launching the Korea SMR Initiative to transfer SMART and other advanced nuclear technologies to the private sector in order to help demonstrate and commercialize new reactors. “To kick start these efforts, starting next year, the Government will collaborate with the relevant companies to invest in developing high temperature gas reactors designed for industrial process heat with applications such as hydrogen production and other uses,” he said.\\\\xa0In Morocco, the Government is considering adding nuclear power to its energy mix to ensure a reliable energy supply. “Morocco places a distinct focus on small modular reactors due to their numerous advantages, including the flexibility for integration,” said Leila Benali, Morocco’s Minister of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development, in a video statement to the Forum. “They hold significant promise for diverse applications, such as combined heat and power generation and seawater desalination.”\\\\xa0Minister Benali also announced that Morocco’s National Centre for Nuclear Energy, Sciences and Technology has been designated as an , enabling it to function as a global learning platform. “Morocco\\\\\\'s national infrastructure that is now reinforced by this recognition is open for the benefit of the African continent with a focus on capacity building,” she said.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0For the past 40 years, Sweden has expanded different forms of renewable energy, with wind power providing a significant share of electricity, and biomass replacing oil and coal for district heating and industrial processes. “What was forgotten, though, was that the power system is very sensitive and that it has to work technically. It\\\\\\'s not just about adding terawatt hours,” said Sweden’s Vice Minister for Climate and the Environment, Daniel Westlén. Considering the requirement for dispatchable energy to meet demand, when and where needed, as well as for demand to be met without carbon emissions, the options are limited. “Nuclear energy is the only option available,” he added.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0To reach climate and net zero goals, studies have estimated a doubling or tripling of nuclear energy capacity by 2050. “Can the world build 20 or even 40 gigawatts of nuclear energy per year? I would claim it is possible. We’ve done it before,” Vice Minister Westlén said. In the 1980s, more than 180 reactors were under construction globally, and more than 30 gigawatts were added in one single year, he explained. Sweden deployed 12 large reactors between 1972 and 1985. While “climate change is the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced… we are in possession of the tools that we will need to solve this,” he concluded.\\\\xa0Last year, French President Emmanuel Macron announced a programme to build six nuclear reactors, as well as a programme dedicated to nuclear and innovation with small and advanced modular reactors. “We need energy, which is at the same time cheap, affordable and sustainable. And that\\\\\\'s not so easy to solve,” said François Jacq, General Administrator of the French Atomic Energy Commission. “That\\\\\\'s why we need innovation.” Innovation will come in many forms – in applications, approaches and technologies – and will also attract the future generation to the nuclear field.\\\\xa0“We will also have to innovate in the field of cooperation, in partnership. We have to invent new forms of cooperation. We have to invent new forms of research and technology organization,” General Administrator Jacq said.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0![]( energy influencer, Isabelle Boemeke, provided the keynote address at the opening session of the\\\\xa0Scientific Forum, Nuclear Innovations for Net Zero, at the IAEA 67th General Conference in Vienna, Austria, 26 September 2023. (Photo: D. Calma/IAEA)Wrapping up the opening session, Brazilian-born nuclear energy influencer Isabelle Boemeke, reflected on the power of social media to inform young audiences. “Social media can sound superficial, but the reality is that\\\\\\'s how young people learn about the world,” said Boemeke, also known as . “They trust influencers’ opinions on products, health tips and ideas. And while we\\\\\\'ve seen social media being used for bad, I believe we can leverage these tools and actually use it for good.”\\\\xa0She brought attention to the value of leaders in listening and engaging with young generations. “Young people are very much open to it, and they\\\\\\'re waiting to hear from people, like yourselves, that it\\\\\\'s OK to support this technology. Getting the population informed on all the benefits grants license to our leaders to pursue realistic decarbonization paths\\\\xa0– paths that very boldly include nuclear power at the heart,” Boemke said. Encouraging the audience of decision makers to be courageous, she concluded by asking, “Are you leaders or followers?”\\\\xa0Read  in the latest \\\\xa0![]( Scientific Forum featured a panel of young professionals in the nuclear field. They discussed their motivation to pursue a career in nuclear and the importance of diversity and inclusion. (Photo: H. Shaffer/IAEA)The Forum included a segment on youth, featuring a panel of young professionals in the nuclear field: Benjamin Bertaux, Junior Decommissioning Expert at the IAEA; Loretta Boahemaa Manu, Associate Transport Safety Officer at the IAEA; Yvonne Lin, Nuclear Engineering Intern at the IAEA; and Grace Stanke, nuclear energy advocate and current-Miss America. They expressed how \"cool\" and attractive the nuclear field is for new generations and the importance of creating collaborative research projects with universities to expose students to various career paths. Insisting on the importance of promoting diversity and inclusion in the nuclear industry, the panel shared that to attract new talent, it is as much about the science as it is about storytelling and innovative ways to communicate about nuclear.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Boahemaa Manu and Lin are both fellows of the , which is open for applicants until 30 September.\\\\xa0The way forward---------------From China to the United Kingdom and beyond, countries around the world have ambitious plans to expand their nuclear fleets. By 2035, China expects to build 150 new nuclear reactors. “We have so many coal-fired power stations that must be replaced by nuclear power,” said Yu Jianfeng,\\\\u202fChairman of China National Nuclear Corporation, during the closing session of the Forum on Wednesday.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0In the United Kingdom, “we have an ambitious target of 24 gigawatts of nuclear power to be on the UK grid by 2050,” said Andrew Bowie, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and Minister for Nuclear and Networks. “As vital as it is to decarbonize our energy baseload, it is also about prices – the cost of living, affordable energy, and being energy secure and independent.”\\\\xa0\\\\xa0When it comes to prices, Finland’s Minister of Climate and Environment, Kai Mykkänen, told the Forum that Finland’s Olkiluoto 3, Europe’s largest nuclear reactor at 1.6 gigawatts, has led to the lowest electricity prices in Finland in years. Olkiluoto 3, which began regular output in April, is the key reason Finland has ceased direct electricity and natural gas imports, while simultaneously lowering electricity prices, he said.\\\\xa0Public acceptance, as well as financing, surrounding nuclear power must also be considered in the path forward. “We have to interact with society to ensure the technical solutions we propose will be, in the end, accepted,” said Peter Baeten, Director General of the Belgian Nuclear Research Center SCK CEN. Furthermore, while technical innovation is essential, there are other aspects of innovation, said Sama Bilbao,\\\\u202fDirector General of World Nuclear Association. “We need innovation in the way we finance new nuclear. We need to think outside the box to attract investment into these nuclear projects,” she added.\\\\xa0Given the speed and scale of innovation within the nuclear field, Director General Grossi is optimistic. “There are challenges, but it is clear – we are moving decisively. We are moving, perhaps, at different paces and in different ways,” he said. “The end result will not be uniform because there is not a one-size-fits-all solution. But we can see how nuclear is very firmly positioned in this global effort that is taking place now.”\\\\xa0\\\\xa0![]( closing session of the Scientific Forum at the IAEA 67th General Conference held at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, Austria, 27 September 2023.

Small modular reactors increase flexibility in capacity thanks to integrated energy systems. Fast reactors, thorium reactors and other new technologies can provide novel fuel cycle solutions. The first session focussed on new reactor concepts that have already been implemented and present visionary outlooks for future developments. It showcased how innovative ideas for small and large reactors will shape our energy future.\\\\xa0**Session 2: Innovative Solutions to Support Nuclear Development**\\\\xa0(.)The prospects for nuclear power depend not only on innovations in reactor technologies but also in manufacturing processes, the security of fuel supply, spent fuel solutions and other factors. There are already examples of how innovations, such as artificial intelligence and additive manufacturing, are paving the way for safe and sustainable solutions that could support cost savings and improve the economics of operating nuclear power plants. The second session explored how innovative solutions — from front end to back end — will enable extended prospects of nuclear power.

Initially, fusion research in the USA and USSR was linked to atomic weapons development, and it remained classified until the 1958 Atoms for Peace conference in Geneva. Following a breakthrough at the Soviet tokamak, fusion research became \\\\\\'big science\\\\\\' in the 1970s. But the cost and complexity of the devices involved increased to the point where international co-operation was the only way forward.\\\\xa0The Fusion Industry Association report \")\\\\xa0said that $2.83 billion of new investment was declared by private nuclear fusion companies since the 2021 edition of the report.Fusion powers the Sun and stars as hydrogen atoms fuse together to form helium, and matter is converted into energy. Hydrogen, heated to very high temperatures changes from a gas to a plasma in which the negatively-charged electrons are separated from the positively-charged atomic nuclei (ions). Normally, fusion is not possible because the strongly repulsive electrostatic forces between the positively charged nuclei prevent them from getting close enough together to collide and for fusion to occur. However, if the conditions are such that the nuclei can overcome the electrostatic forces to the extent that they can come within a very close range of each other, then the attractive nuclear force (which binds protons and neutrons together in atomic nuclei) between the nuclei will outweigh the repulsive (electrostatic) force, allowing the nuclei to fuse together. Such conditions can occur when the temperature increases, causing the ions to move faster and eventually reach speeds high enough to bring the ions close enough together. The nuclei can then fuse, causing a release of energy.Fusion technology-----------------In the Sun, massive gravitational forces create the right conditions for fusion, but on Earth they are much harder to achieve. Fusion fuel – different isotopes of hydrogen – must be heated to extreme temperatures of the order of 50 million degrees Celsius, and must be kept stable under intense pressure, hence dense enough and confined for long enough to allow the nuclei to fuse. The aim of the controlled fusion research program is to achieve \\\\\\'ignition\\\\\\', which occurs when enough fusion reactions take place for the process to become self-sustaining, with fresh fuel then being added to continue it.\\\\xa0Once ignition is achieved, there is net energy yield – about four times as much as with nuclear fission. According to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the amount of power produced increases with the square of the pressure, so doubling the pressure leads to a fourfold increase in energy production.With current technology, the reaction most readily feasible is between the nuclei of the two heavy forms (isotopes) of hydrogen – deuterium (D) and tritium (T). Each D-T fusion event releases 17.6 MeV (2.8 x 10-12 joule, compared with 200 MeV for a U-235 fission and 3-4 MeV for D-D fusion). On a mass basis, the D-T fusion reaction releases over four times as much energy as uranium fission. Deuterium occurs naturally in seawater (30 grams per cubic metre), which makes it very abundant relative to other energy resources. Tritium occurs naturally only in trace quantities (produced by cosmic rays) and is radioactive, with a half-life of around 12 years. Usable quantities can be made in a conventional nuclear reactor, or in the present context, bred in a fusion system from lithium. Lithium is found in large quantities (30 parts per million) in the Earth\\\\\\'s crust and in weaker concentrations in the sea.In a fusion reactor, the concept is that neutrons generated from the D-T fusion reaction will be absorbed in a blanket containing lithium which surrounds the core. The lithium is then transformed into tritium (which is used to fuel the reactor) and helium. The blanket must be thick enough (about 1 metre) to slow down the\\\\xa0high-energy (14 MeV) neutrons. The kinetic energy of the neutrons is absorbed by the blanket, causing it to heat up. The heat energy is collected by the coolant (water, helium or Li-Pb eutectic) flowing through the blanket and, in a fusion power plant, this energy will be used to generate electricity by conventional methods.\\\\xa0If insufficient tritium is produced, some supplementary source must be employed such as using a fission reactor to irradiate heavy water or lithium with neutrons, and extraneous tritium creates difficulties with handling, storage and transport.The difficulty has been to develop a device that can heat the D-T fuel to a high enough temperature and confine it long enough so that more energy is released through fusion reactions than is used to get the reaction going. While the D-T reaction is the main focus of attention, long-term hopes are for a D-D reaction, but this requires much higher temperatures.In any case, the challenge is to apply the heat to human needs, primarily generating electricity. The energy density of fusion reactions in gas is very much less than for fission reactions in solid fuel, and as noted the heat yield per reaction is 70 times less. Hence thermonuclear fusion will always have a much lower power density than nuclear fission, which means that any fusion reactor needs to be larger and therefore more costly, than a fission reactor of the same power output. In addition, nuclear fission reactors use solid fuel which is denser than a thermonuclear plasma, so the energy released is more concentrated.\\\\xa0Also the neutron energy from fusion is higher than from fission – 14.1 MeV instead of about 2 MeV, which presents significant challenges regarding structural materials.At present, two main experimental approaches are being studied: magnetic confinement and inertial confinement. The first method uses strong magnetic fields to contain the hot plasma. The second involves compressing a small pellet containing fusion fuel to extremely high densities using strong lasers or particle beams.\\\\xa0A range of magnetized target fusion systems are also being developed, along with experiments with hybrid fusion.### Magnetic confinementIn magnetic confinement fusion (MCF), hundreds of cubic metres of D-T plasma at a density of less than a milligram per cubic metre are confined by a magnetic field at a few atmospheres pressure and heated to fusion temperature.Magnetic fields are ideal for confining a plasma because the electrical charges on the separated ions and electrons mean that they follow the magnetic field lines. The aim is to prevent the particles from coming into contact with the reactor walls as this will dissipate their heat and slow them down. The most effective magnetic configuration is toroidal, shaped like a doughnut, in which the magnetic field is curved around to form a closed loop. For proper confinement, this toroidal field must have superimposed upon it a perpendicular field component (a poloidal field). The result is a magnetic field with force lines following spiral (helical) paths that confine and control the plasma.There are several types of toroidal confinement system, the most important being tokamaks, stellarators and reversed field pinch (RFP) devices.In a tokamak, the toroidal field is created by a series of coils evenly spaced around the torus-shaped reactor, and the poloidal field is created by a system of horizontal coils outside the toroidal magnet structure. A strong electric current is induced in the plasma using a central solenoid, and this induced current also contributes to the poloidal field. In a stellarator, the helical lines of force are produced by a series of coils which may themselves be helical in shape. Unlike tokamaks, stellarators do not require a toroidal current to be induced in the plasma. RFP devices have the same toroidal and poloidal components as a tokamak, but the current flowing through the plasma is much stronger and the direction of the toroidal field within the plasma is reversed.In tokamaks and RFP devices, the current flowing through the plasma also serves to heat it to a temperature of about 10 million degrees Celsius. Beyond that, additional heating systems are needed to achieve the temperatures necessary for fusion. In stellarators, these heating systems have to supply all the energy needed.The tokamak (_toroidalnya kamera ee magnetnaya katushka_ – torus-shaped magnetic chamber) was designed in 1951 by Soviet physicists Andrei Sakharov and Igor Tamm. Tokamaks operate within limited parameters outside which sudden losses of energy confinement (disruptions) can occur, causing major thermal and mechanical stresses to the structure and walls. Nevertheless, it is considered the most promising design, and research is continuing on various tokamaks around the world.Research is also being carried out on several types of stellarator. Lyman Spitzer devised and began work on the first fusion device – a stellarator – at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory in 1951. Due to the difficulty in confining plasmas, stellarators fell out of favour until computer modelling techniques allowed accurate geometries to be calculated. Because stellarators have no toroidal plasma current, plasma stability is increased compared with tokamaks. Since the burning plasma can be more easily controlled and monitored, stellerators have an intrinsic potential for steady-state, continuous operation. The disadvantage is that, due to their more complex shape, stellarators are much more complex than tokamaks to design and build.RFP devices differ from tokamaks mainly in the spatial distribution of the toroidal magnetic field, which changes sign at the edge of the plasma. The RFX machine in Padua, Italy is used to study the physical problems arising from the spontaneous reorganization of the magnetic field, which is an intrinsic feature of this configuration.### Inertial confinementIn inertial confinement fusion, which is a newer line of research, laser or ion beams are focused very precisely onto the surface of a target, which is a pellet of D-T fuel, a few millimetres in diameter. This heats the outer layer of the material, which explodes outwards generating an inward-moving compression front or implosion that compresses and heats the inner layers of material. The core of the fuel may be compressed to one thousand times its liquid density, resulting in conditions where fusion can occur. The energy released then would heat the surrounding fuel, which may also undergo fusion leading to a chain reaction (known as ignition) as the reaction spreads outwards through the fuel. The time required for these reactions to occur is limited by the inertia of the fuel (hence the name), but is less than a microsecond. So far, most inertial confinement work has involved lasers.Recent work at Osaka University\\\\\\'s Institute of Laser Engineering in Japan suggests that ignition may be achieved at lower temperature with a second very intense laser pulse guided through a millimetre-high gold cone into the compressed fuel, and timed to coincide with the peak compression. This technique, known as \\\\\\'fast ignition\\\\\\', means that fuel compression is separated from hot spot generation with ignition, making the process more practical.In the UK  based near Oxford is researching inertial fusion energy (IFE) with a focus on power driver technology using an asymmetric implosion approach. As well as power generation, the company envisages material processing and chemical manufacturing applications. In March 2025 the company announced that it would focus on providing its amplifier technology, dropping earlier plans to develop a power plant.The US  is a large laser-based inertial confinement fusion research device at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. It focuses 192 powerful laser beams into a small target in a few billionths of a second, delivering more than 2 MJ of ultraviolet energy and 500 TW of peak power.A completely different concept, the \\\\\\'Z-pinch\\\\\\' (or \\\\\\'zeta pinch\\\\\\'), uses a strong electrical current in a plasma to generate X-rays, which compress a tiny D-T fuel cylinder.### Magnetized target fusionMagnetized target fusion (MTF), also referred to as magneto-inertial fusion (MIF), is a pulsed approach to fusion that combines the compressional heating of inertial confinement fusion with the magnetically reduced thermal transport and magnetically enhanced alpha heating of magnetic confinement fusion.A range of MTF systems are currently being experimented with, and commonly use a magnetic field to confine a plasma with compressional heating provided by laser, electromagnetic or mechanical liner implosion. As a result of this combined approach, shorter plasma confinement times are required than for magnetic confinement (from 100 ns to 1 ms, depending on the MIF approach), reducing the requirement to stabilize the plasma for long periods. Conversely, compression can be achieved over timescales longer than those typical for inertial confinement, making it possible to achieve compression through mechanical, magnetic, chemical, or relatively low-powered laser drivers.Several approaches are underway to examine MTF, including experiments at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratory, the University of Rochester, and private companies General Fusion and Helion Energy.R&D challenges for MTF include whether a suitable target plasma can be formed and heated to fusion conditions while avoiding contamination from the liner, as with magnetic confinement and inertial confinement. Due to the reduced demands on confinement time and compression velocities, MTF has been pursued as a lower-cost and simpler approach to investigating these challenges than conventional fusion projects.In the UK General Fusion\\\\\\'s  at the UK Atomic Energy Authority\\\\\\'s Culham Campus, near Oxford, received planning consent for construction in January 2022. The company aims to construct a fusion energy power plant by the early 2030s.### Hybrid fusionFusion can also be combined with fission in what is referred to as hybrid nuclear fusion where the blanket surrounding the core is a subcritical fission reactor. The fusion reaction acts as a source of neutrons for the surrounding blanket, where these neutrons are captured, resulting in fission reactions taking place. These fission reactions would also produce more neutrons, thereby assisting further fission reactions in the blanket.The concept of hybrid fusion can be compared with an accelerator-driven system (ADS), where an accelerator is the source of neutrons for the blanket assembly, rather than nuclear fusion reactions (see page on ). The blanket of a hybrid fusion system can therefore contain the same fuel as an ADS – for example, the abundant element thorium or the long-lived heavy isotopes present in used nuclear fuel (from a conventional reactor) could be used as fuel.The blanket containing fission fuel in a hybrid fusion system would not require the development of new materials capable of withstanding constant neutron bombardment, whereas such materials would be needed in the blanket of a \\\\\\'conventional\\\\\\' fusion system. A further advantage of a hybrid system is that the fusion part would not need to produce as many neutrons as a (non-hybrid) fusion reactor would in order to generate more power than is consumed – so a commercial-scale fusion reactor in a hybrid system does not need to be as large as a fusion-only reactor.Fusion research---------------A long-standing quip about fusion points out that, since the 1970s, commercial deployment of fusion power has always been about 40 years away. While there is some truth in this, many breakthroughs have been made, particularly in recent years, and there are a number of major projects under development that may bring research to the point where fusion power can be commercialized.Several **tokamaks** have been built, including the Joint European Torus (JET)\\\\xa0and the Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak (MAST)\\\\xa0in the UK and the tokamak fusion test reactor (TFTR) at Princeton in the USA. The ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) project currently under construction in Cadarache, France will be the largest tokamak when it operates in the 2020s. The Chinese Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR) is a tokamak which is reported to be larger than ITER, and due for completion in 2030.\\\\xa0Meanwhile it is running its Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST). In the UK, Tokamak Energy has commissioned and is further developing its ST40 tokamak.\\\\xa0In March 2022 the US Department of Energy announced up to $50 million of federal funding to support US scientists conducting experimental research in fusion energy science. $20 million of this would support tokamak facilities, while the other $30 million would support\\\\xa0research to improve fusion performance and increase the duration of burning plasma scenarios.Much research has also been carried out on **stellarators**. A large one of these, the Large Helical Device at Japan\\\\\\'s National Institute of Fusion Research, began operating in 1998. It is being used to study the best magnetic configuration for plasma confinement. At the Garching site of the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Germany, research carried out at the Wendelstein 7-AS between 1988 and 2002 is being progressed at the Wendelstein 7-X, which was built over 19 years at Max Planck Institute\\\\\\'s Greifswald site and started up at the end of 2015. Another stellarator, TJII, is in operation in Madrid, Spain. In the USA, at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, where the first stellarators were built in 1951, construction on the NCSX stellerator was abandoned in 2008 due to cost overruns and lack of funding.There have also been significant developments in research into **inertial fusion energy** (IFE). Construction of the\\\\xa0$7 billion National Ignition Facility (NIF) at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), funded by the National Nuclear Security Administration, was completed in March 2009. The Laser Mégajoule (LMJ) in France’s Bordeaux region started operation in October 2014. Both are designed to deliver, in a few billionths of a second, nearly two million joules of light energy to targets measuring a few millimeters in size. The main purpose of both NIF and LMJ is\\\\xa0for research to support both countries\\\\\\' respective\\\\xa0nuclear weapons programs.In September 2021 the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) opened the Fusion Technology Facility at the Advanced Manufacturing Park in Rotherham. It will house test rigs including the Combined Heating and Magnetic Research Apparatus (CHIMERA), which would be the only device capable of\\\\xa0simulating\\\\xa0conditions of a fusion power plant to test prototype components.### ITERIn 1985, the Soviet Union suggested building a next generation tokamak with Europe, Japan and the USA. Collaboration was established under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Between 1988 and 1990, the initial designs were drawn up for an International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER, which also means \\\\\\'a path\\\\\\' or \\\\\\'journey\\\\\\' in Latin) with the aim of proving that fusion could produce useful energy. The four parties agreed in 1992 to collaborate further on engineering design activities for ITER. Canada and Kazakhstan are also involved through Euratom and Russia, respectively.Six years later, the ITER Council approved the first comprehensive design of a fusion reactor based on well-established physics and technology with a price tag of $6 billion. Then the USA decided pull out of the project, forcing a 50% reduction in costs and a redesign. The result was the ITER Fusion Energy Advanced Tokomak (ITER-FEAT) – initially expected to cost $3 billion but still achieve the targets of a self-sustaining reaction and a net energy gain. The envisaged energy gain is unlikely to be enough for a power plant, but it should demonstrate feasibility.In 2003, the USA rejoined the project and China also announced it would join. After deadlocked discussion, the six partners agreed in mid-2005 to site ITER at Cadarache, in southern France. The deal involved major concessions to Japan, which had put forward Rokkasho as a preferred site. The European Union (EU) and France would contribute half of the then estimated €12.8 billion total cost, with the other partners – Japan, China, South Korea, USA and Russia – putting in 10% each. Japan will provide a lot of the high-tech components, will host a €1 billion materials testing facility – the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF) – and will have the right to host a subsequent demonstration fusion reactor. India became the seventh member of the ITER consortium at the end of 2005. In November 2006, the seven members – China, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea, the USA and the European Union – signed the ITER implementing agreement.\\\\xa0The total cost of the 500 MW ITER comprises about half for the ten-year construction and half for 20 years of operation.Site preparation works at Cadarache commenced in January 2007. First concrete for the buildings was poured in December 2013. Experiments were due to begin in 2018, when hydrogen will be used to avoid activating the magnets, but this is now expected in 2035. The first D-T plasma is not expected until 2035.\\\\xa0ITER is large because confinement time increases with the cube of machine size. The vacuum vessel will be 19 m across and 11 m high, and weigh more than 5000 tonnes.The goal of ITER is to operate with a plasma thermal output of 500 MW (for at least 400 seconds continuously) with less than 50 MW of plasma heating power input. No electricity will be generated at ITER.An associated CEA facility at Cadarache is WEST, formerly Tore Supra, which is designed to test prototype components and accelerate their development for ITER. It is focused on the divertor structure to remove helium, testing the durability of tungsten materials used.A 2 GW Demonstration Power Plant, known as Demo, is expected to demonstrate large-scale production of electrical power on a continual basis. The conceptual design of Demo was expected to be completed by 2017, with construction beginning around 2024 and the first phase of operation commencing from 2033. It has since been delayed, with construction now planned for after 2040.In November 2022 it was announced that a defect had been discovered in the thermal shields and vacuum vessel of ITER. The bending and welding of cooling fluid in pipes to the thermal shield panels\\\\xa0resulted in stress corrosion cracking of up to 2.2mm deep in the pipes. Due to the risk of leaking, the installed module will\\\\xa0need to be lifted out and disassembled\\\\xa0in order to proceed with the repairs. ITER director general Pietro Barabaschi\\\\xa0said the consequences on schedule and cost \"will not be insignificant\". In March 2025 the manufacturing of the second vaccum vessel was completed.### JETIn 1978, the European Community (Euratom, along with Sweden and Switzerland) launched the Joint European Torus (JET) project in the UK. JET is the largest tokamak operating in the world today. A similar tokamak, JT-60, operates at the Naka Fusion Institute of Japan Atomic Energy Agency in Japan, but only JET has the facilities to use D-T fuel.Following a legal dispute with Euratom, in December 1999 JET\\\\\\'s international contract ended and the UKAEA\\\\xa0took over the management of JET on behalf of its European partners. From that time JET\\\\\\'s experimental programme has been co-ordinated by the European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA) parties.\\\\xa0JET is operated by the UKAEA\\\\\\'s Culham Centre for Fusion Research, a member of the EUROfusion consortium.JET produced its first plasma in 1983, and became the first experiment to produce controlled fusion power in November 1991, albeit with high input of electricity. Up to 16 MW of fusion power for one second and 5 MW sustained has been achieved in D-T plasmas using the device, from 24 MW of power injected into its heating system, and many experiments are conducted to study different heating schemes and other techniques. JET has been very successful in operating remote handling techniques in a radioactive environment to modify the interior of the device and has shown that the remote handling maintenance of fusion devices is realistic.JET is a key device in preparations for ITER. It has been significantly upgraded in recent years to test ITER plasma physics and engineering systems. Further enhancements are planned at JET with a view to exceeding its fusion power record in future D-T experiments. A compact device – Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak (MAST) – was developed alongside JET at Culham, partly to serve the ITER project, and the substantial\\\\xa0MAST Upgrade\\\\xa0project is now being implemented in stages to increase neutral beam power from 5 to 12.5 MW and the energy deposited in plasma from 2.5 to 30 MJ. MAST Upgrade is focused on designing a plasma exhaust system or divertor that would be able withstand the intense power loads created in commercial-sized fusion reactors. It achieved first plasma in October 2020.In 2019 the UK government committed £22 million over four years for the conceptual design of the Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP) at Culham. The technical objectives of STEP are: to deliver predictable net electricity greater than 100 MW; to exploit fusion energy beyond electricity production; to ensure tritium self-sufficiency; to qualify materials and components under appropriate fusion conditions of neutron flux; and to develop a viable path to affordable life-cycle costs. STEP is scheduled for completion in 2040.\\\\xa0In February 2022 researchers at JET achieved 59 megajoules of heat energy from fusion over a five-second period, doubling previous records.### Tokamak EnergyTokamak Energy in the UK is a private company developing a spherical tokamak, and hopes to commercialize this by 2030. The company grew out of Culham laboratory, home to JET, and its technology revolves around high temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets, which allow for relatively low-power and small-size devices, but high performance and potentially widespread commercial deployment. Its first tokamak with exclusively HTS magnets\\\\xa0– the ST25 HTS, Tokamak Energy\\\\\\'s second reactor\\\\xa0– demonstrated 29 hours\\\\\\' continuous plasma during the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition in London in 2015, a world record.The next reactor is the ST40 at Milton Park in Oxfordshire, which achieved first plasma in April 2017. It produced plasma temperatures of 15 million degrees Celsius in 2018 and 2019 after the commissioning of further magnetic coils. Chief executive of Tokamak Energy David Kingham said: \"The ST40 is designed to achieve 100 million degrees C and get within a factor of ten of energy break-even conditions.” The company is working with Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory on spherical tokamaks, and with the Plasma Science and Fusion Centre at MIT on HTS magnets.\\\\xa0In July 2020 it was awarded £10 million from the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), as part of the government’s Advanced Modular Reactor project. The funds will contribute to core development work on high temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets and plasma exhaust system (divertor) technologies. The divertor must handle high levels of heat and particle bombardment while removing impurities and waste from the system. It aims to have a prototype delivering electricity to the grid by 2030.### KSTARThe KSTAR (Korean Superconducting Tokamak Reactor) at the National Fusion Research Institute (NFRI) in Daejeon produced its first plasma in mid-2008. It is a pilot device for ITER, and involves much international collaboration. It will be a satellite of ITER during ITER’s operational phase. The tokamak with 1.8 metre major radius is the first to use Nb3Sn superconducting magnets, the same material to be used in the ITER project. Its first stage of development to 2012 was to prove baseline operation technologies and achieved plasma pulses of up to 20 seconds. For the second phase of development (2013-2017), KSTAR was upgraded to study long pulses of up to 300 seconds in H mode – the 100s target was in 2015 – and embark upon high-performance AT mode. It achieved 70 seconds in high-performance plasma operation in late 2016, a world record. In addition, KSTAR researchers also succeeded in achieving an alternative advanced plasma operation mode with the internal transport barrier (ITB). This is a steep pressure gradient in the core of the plasmas due to the enhanced core plasma confinement. NFRI said this is the first ITB operation achieved in the superconducting device at the lowest heating power. KSTAR Phase 3 (2018-2023) is to develop high performance, high efficiency AT mode technologies with long-pulse operation. Phase 4 (2023-2025) will test DEMO-related prior arts. The device does not have tritium handling capabilities, so will not use D-T fuel.### K-DEMO tokamakIn collaboration with the US Department of Energy\\\\\\'s Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) in New Jersey and South Korea’s National Fusion Research Institute (NFRI) K-DEMO is intended to be the next step toward commercial reactors from ITER, and would be the first plant to actually contribute power to an electric grid. According to the PPPL, it would generate \"some 1 billion watts of power for several weeks on end\", a much greater output than ITER\\\\\\'s goal of producing 500 million watts for 500 seconds by the late 2020s. K-DEMO is expected to have a 6.65m diameter major radius tokamak, and a test blanket module as part of the DEMO breeding blanket R&D. The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology plans to invest about KRW 1 trillion (US$ 941 million) in the project. About KRW 300 billion of that spending has already been funded. The government expects the project to employ nearly 2,400 people in the first phase, which will last throughout 2016. K-DEMO is expected to have an initial operational phase from about 2037 to 2050 to develop components for the second stage, which would produce electricity.### FAST (Fusion by Advanced Superconducting Tokamak)FAST aims to generate and sustain a plasma of deuterium-tritium (D-T) reactions, demonstrating an integrated fusion energy system that combines energy conversion including electricity generation and fuel technologies. To be sited in Japan, the project aims for power generation demonstration by the end of the 2030s. The aim is for power generation of 50 to 100 MW with 1000 seconds of D-T fusion burn, with the device planned to operate for a cumulative 1000 hours of full-power operation.EASTIn China the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) at China Academy of Sciences\\\\\\' Hefei Institutes of Physical Science (HFIPS) produced hydrogen plasma at 50 million degrees Celsius and held it for 102 seconds in 2017. In November 2018 it achieved 100 million degrees Celsius for 10 seconds, with input of 10 MW of electric power. In July 2020 EAST achieved a completely non-inductive, current-driven, steady-state plasma for over 100 seconds, claimed as a breakthrough with significant implications for the future China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR). In May 2021 it set a new world record of achieving a plasma temperature of 120 million degrees Celsius for 101 seconds. The experiment also realized a plasma temperature of 160 million degrees Celsius, lasting 20 seconds.TFTRIn the USA, the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) operated at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) from 1982 to 1997. In December 1993, TFTR became the first magnetic fusion device to perform extensive experiments with plasmas composed of D-T. The following year TFTR produced 10.7 MW of controlled fusion power – a record at that time. TFTR set other records, including the achievement of a plasma temperature of 510 million degrees centigrade in 1995. However, it did not achieve its goal of break-even fusion energy (where the energy input required is no greater than the amount of fusion energy produced), but achieved all of its hardware design goals, thus making substantial contributions to the development of ITER.ALCATORAt the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) since the 1970s a succession of small ALCATOR (Alto Campus Torus) high magnetic field torus reactors have operated on the principle of achieving high plasma pressure as the route to long plasma confinement. Alcator C-Mod is claimed to have the highest magnetic field and highest plasma pressure of any fusion reactor, and is the largest university-based fusion reactor in the world. It operated 1993-2016. In September 2016 it achieved a plasma pressure of 2.05 atmospheres at a temperature of 35 million degrees Celsius. The plasma produced 300 trillion fusion reactions per second and had a central magnetic field strength of 5.7 tesla. It carried 1.4 million amps of electrical current and was heated with over 4 MW of power. The reaction occurred in a volume of approximately 1 cubic metre and the plasma lasted for two seconds. Having achieved this record performance for a fusion reactor, government funding ceased.A scaled-up version planned to be built at Triotsk near Moscow in collaboration with the Kurchatov Institute is Ignitor, with 1.3 m diameter torus.### Large Helical Device\\\\xa0– stellaratorThe Large Helical Device (LHD) at Japan\\\\\\'s National Institute for Fusion Science in Toki, in the Gifu Prefecture, was the world\\\\\\'s largest stellarator. LHD produced its first plasma in 1998 and has demonstrated plasma confinement properties comparable to other large fusion devices. It has achieved an ion temperature of 13.5 keV (about 160 million degrees) and plasma stored energy of 1.44 million joules (MJ).### Wendelstein 7-X stellaratorFollowing a year of tests, this started up at the end of 2015, and helium plasma briefly reached about one million degrees centigrade.\\\\xa0In 2016 it progressed to using hydrogen, and using 2 MW it achieved plasma of 80 million degrees centigrade for a quarter of a second. W7-X is the world’s largest stellarator and it is planned to operate continuously for up to 30 minutes. It cost €1 billion ($1.1 billion).\\\\xa0\\\\xa0  Some good diagrams are in a\\\\xa0\\\\xa0on the Wendelstein 7-X.### Heliac-1 stellaratorAt the\\\\xa0Australian Plasma Fusion Research Facility\\\\xa0at the Australian National University the H-1 stellarator has run for some years and in 2014 was upgraded significantly. H-1 is capable of accessing a wide range of plasma configurations and allows exploration of ideas for improved magnetic design of the fusion power stations that will follow ITER.### National\\\\xa0Ignition\\\\xa0Facility\\\\xa0– laserThe world\\\\\\'s most powerful laser fusion facility, the $4 billion National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), was completed in March 2009. Using its 192 laser beams, NIF is able to deliver more than 60 times the energy of any previous laser system to its target. LLNL announced in July 2012 that in \"an historic record-breaking laser shot, the NIF laser system of 192 beams delivered more than 500 TW of peak power and 1.85 megajoules (MJ) of ultraviolet laser light to its (2mm diameter) target\" for a few trillionths of a second. In September 2013 for the first time the amount of energy released through the fusion reaction (14 kJ) exceeded the amount of energy being absorbed by the fuel, but not the amount supplied by the giant lasers (1.8 MJ). In August 2021 LLNL said that it had achieved a yield of 1.3 MJ, much better than its previous best of 55 kJ in 2018. It said this was \"a historic step forward for inertial confinment\" putting it \"at the threshold of fusion ignition.\"\\\\xa0In August 2021 NIF achieved a record fusion yield of 1.3 megajoules – 24 times greater than its previous best experiment – which LLNL said places it \"at the threshold of fusion ignition\".\\\\xa0A breakthrough in December 2022 resulted in an NIF experiment demonstrating the fundamental scientific basis for inertial confinement fusion energy for the first time. The experiment created fusion ignition when using 192 laser beams to deliver more than 2 MJ of ultraviolet energy to a deuterium-tritium fuel pellet.An earlier high-power laser at LLNL, Nova, was built in 1984 for the purpose of achieving ignition. Nova failed to do this and was closed in 1999, but provided essential data that led to the design of NIF. Nova also generated considerable amounts of data on high-density matter physics, which is useful both in fusion power and nuclear weapons research.In connection with NIF, LLNL is developing the Laser Inertial Fusion Engine (LIFE), a hybrid fusion system where neutrons resulting from laser fusion would drive a subcritical nuclear fission blanket to generate electricity. The blanket would contain either depleted uranium; used nuclear fuel; natural uranium or thorium; or plutonium-239, minor actinides and fission products from reprocessed used nuclear fuel.### Laser MégajouleMeanwhile, the French Atomic Energy Commission (Commissariat à l\\\\\\'énergie atomique, CEA) has operated a similar size laser – the Laser Mégajoule (LMJ) – near Bordeaux since 2014. Its 240 laser beams are able to generate 1.8 MJ pulses for a few billionths of a second, concentrated on a small deuterium and tritium target. A prototype laser, the Ligne d\\\\\\'Integration Laser (LIL), commenced operation in 2003.### SG-IIChina’s National Laboratory of High-Power Laser and Physics, associated with the China Academy of Science, has a laser inertial confinement experiment in Shanghai – the Shenguang-II eight-beam laser facility (SG-II), similar to the National Ignition Facility in the USA and Laser Mégajoule in France. It is the only high power neodymium-glass solid laser facility with an active probe light in China.\\\\u202fIn 2005 a ninth beam was added, advancing the capacity for fusion research. The SG-II facility is China’s high-power laser technology international demonstration base.### PETAL and HiPER lasersThe Petawatt Aquitaine Laser (PETAL) laser facility is a high energy multi-petawatt laser (3.5 kJ energy with a duration of 0.5 to 5 ps) under construction near Bordeaux, on the same site as LIL. PETAL will be coupled with LIL to demonstrate the physics and laser technology of fast ignition.The High Power Laser Energy Research Facility (HiPER) is being designed to build on the research planned at the PETAL project. HiPER will use a long pulse laser (currently estimated at 200kJ) combined with a 70kJ short pulse laser. A three-year preparatory phase that commenced in 2008 has direct funding or in-kind commitments amounting to around €70 million from several countries. The detailed engineering phase is projected to begin in 2011, with a six-year construction phase possibly commencing by 2014.### Z machineOperated by Sandia National Laboratories, the Z machine is the largest X-ray generator in the world. As with NIF, the facility was built as part of the country\\\\\\'s Stockpile Stewardship Program, which aims to maintain the stockpile of nuclear weapons without the need for full-scale testing.Conditions for fusion are achieved by passing a powerful electrical pulse (lasting less than 100 nanoseconds) through a set of fine tungsten wires inside a metal hohlraum. The wires turn into a plasma and experience a compression (\\\\\\'Z-pinch\\\\\\'), forcing the vapourized particles to collide with each other, thereby producing intense X-ray radiation. A tiny cylinder containing fusion fuel placed inside the hohlraum would therefore be compressed by the X-rays, allowing fusion to occur.In 2006, Z machine had achieved temperatures of over 2 billion degrees, considerably higher than what is needed for fusion, and in theory high enough to allow nuclear fusion of hydrogen with heavier elements such as lithium or boron.### Other fusion projectsThere is a considerable amount of research into many other fusion projects at various stages of development.**Lockheed CFR**. Lockheed Martin at its so-called ‘skunk works’ is developing a  (CFR) which uses conventional D-T plasma in evacuated containment but confines it differently. Instead of constraining the plasma within tubular rings, a series of superconducting coils will generate a new magnetic-field geometry in which the plasma is held within the broader confines of the entire reaction chamber. The energy is supplied by radiofrequency heating. Superconducting magnets within the coils will generate a magnetic field around the outer border of the chamber. The aim is to go to plasma pressure being as great as confining pressure at high enough temperature for ignition and net energy yield. Heat exchangers in the reactor wall would convey energy to a gas turbine. It has progressed to a magentized ion confinement experiment, but has some way to go before any prototype, which they claim will be very much smaller than conventional designs such as the ITER tokamak.Italy\\\\\\'s National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA) is developing a small tokamak reactor by the name of **Ignitor**. Under an Italian-Russian agreement signed in May 2010, a reactor will be assembled in Italy and installed at the Kurchatov Institute\\\\\\'s Troitsk Institute for Innovation and Fusion Research (TRINITI) near Moscow.An alternative to using powerful lasers for inertial confinement fusion is \\\\\\'**heavy ion fusion**\\\\\\', where high-energy particles from an accelerator are focused using magnetic fields onto the fusion target.\\\\xa0The  (Neutralized Drift Compression Experiment II) accelerator has been used for heavy ion fusion experiments since 2012 at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. It is being expanded to deliver short intense pulses of ion beams with kinetic energy of 1.2 MeV. High-energy-density physics (HEDP) experiments with laboratory plasmas is a growing part of inertial fusion energy (IFE) physics. (Lawrenceville Plasma Physics) is a US enterprise developing aneutronic fusion using a dense plasma focus device (DPF or **focus fusion**) and hydrogen-boron fuel. The hydrogen and boron (B-11) as plasma fuse at high temperature to form a pulsed beam of helium nuclei without emitting neutrons. (The boron and hydrogen combine to produce a brief intermediate carbon-12 atom which rapidly decays to three alpha particles.) This charged high-energy ion beam generates electricity as it passes through a series of coils similar to a transformer, at 80% efficiency. The balance of energy is as by-product X-rays which are captured in an array of photoelectric receptors. LPP Fusion has achieved electron energies of 400 keV.Another line of fusion research using lasers also involves fusing hydrogen and boron-11 to produce helium nuclei, which continue the chain reaction from boron. One laser generates a powerful magnetic confinement field in a coil to trap the fusion reaction in a small area for a nanosecond, while a second more powerful laser triggers the nuclear fusion process. Early H-11B fusion trials at the Prague Asterix Laser System, using high-energy iodine lasers, have generated more energy than needed to trigger the fusion process.\\\\xa0in Australia develops this and is aiming to use non-thermal laser technology to fuse hydrogen and boron-11. A nanosecond laser pulse ignites a H-B fusion reaction, then a second laser and capacitive coil produce a kilotesla magnetic field to increase the reaction yield. This step is now the focus of research. The yield is increased further by a chain reaction to create helium nuclei which are captured in a charged sphere of at least two metres diameter to produce electricity directly, without any steam circuit. The 2.9 MeV alpha particles represent up to 300 kWh of energy per 15 mg H-11B fuel. A new project is developing fuel materials by synthesizing boron-11-enriched hydrogen borides and hydrogen-adsorbed boron nitride nanosheets. These will be tested at laser facilities overseas.The **Polywell** (\\\\\\'polyhedron\\\\\\' combined with \\\\\\'potential well\\\\\\')\\\\xa0device\\\\xa0consists of magnetic coils arranged in a polyhedral configuration of six sides, forming a cube. A cloud of electrons is confined in the middle of the device so as to be able to accelerate and confine the positive ions to be fused. This electrostatic confinement concept differs from traditional magnetic confinement because the fields do not need to confine ions\\\\xa0– only electrons.  has been researching the Polywell concept and looking at hydrogen and boron as fuel for aneutronic fusion. This followed some years of development by the US Navy, using deuterium fuel.**** is one of a number of private efforts to develop a commercial fusion power plant. The company’s magnetized target fusion (MTF) approach generates a compact toroid plasma in an injector, containing and compressing it using a magnetic field before injecting it into a spherical compression chamber. The chamber holds a liquid lead-lithium liner which is pumped to create a vortex, into which the plasma target is injected. A synchronized array of pistons firing simultaneously creates a spherical compression wave in the liquid metal, compressing the plasma target and heating it to fusion conditions. Founded in Canada in 2002, General Fusion is funded by a syndicate of private investors, energy venture capital companies, sovereign wealth funds and the Canadian government’s Sustainable Development Technology Canada (SDTC) fund. A further government grant was announced in October 2018, from the Strategic Innovation Fund. The company has demonstrated milestones including creating 200-300 eV magnetized spheromak plasmas and confining them for over 500 µs.Much of current work underway on MTF is derived from programmes at the Soviet Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy, under E. P. Velikhov, circa 1970. This inspired the LINUS project at the Naval Research Laboratory in the USA, and later the fast-liner project at Los Alamos.General Atomics has operated the  tokamak in San Diego for the US Department of Energy since the late 1980s. It aims to establish the scientific basis for optimizing the tokamak approach to fusion energy production.### Cold fusionIn March 1989, spectacular claims were made for another approach, when two researchers, in the USA (Stanley Pons) and the UK (Martin Fleischmann), claimed to have achieved fusion in a simple tabletop apparatus working at room temperature. \\\\\\'N-Fusion\\\\\\', or \\\\\\'cold fusion\\\\\\', involves the electrolysis of heavy water using palladium electrodes on which deuterium nuclei are said to concentrate at very high densities. The researchers claimed that heat – which could only be explained in terms of nuclear processes – was produced, as well as fusion byproducts, including helium, tritium and neutrons. Other experimenters failed to replicate this, however, and most of the scientific community no longer considers it a real phenomenon.### Low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR)Initiated by claims for ‘cold fusion’, research at the nanotechnology level is continuing on low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR) which apparently use weak nuclear interactions (rather than strong force as in nuclear fission or fusion) to create low-energy neutrons, followed by neutron capture processes resulting in isotopic change or transmutation, without the emission of strong prompt radiation. LENR experiments involve hydrogen or deuterium permeation through a catalytic layer and reaction with a metal. Researchers report that energy is released, though on any reproducible basis, very little more than is input. The main practical example is hydrogen plus nickel powder evidently giving more heat than can be explained on any chemical basis.The Japanese government is sponsoring LENR research\\\\xa0– notably a nano-metal hydrogen energy project (MHE)\\\\xa0– through its New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), and Mitsubishi is also active in research.\\\\xa0Over 2015-2019 Google funded 30 researchers on three projects and found no evidence that LENR is possible, but they made some advances in measurement and materials science techniques. There was some indication that the two projects involving palladium merited further study.Assessing fusion power----------------------The use of fusion power plants could substantially reduce the environmental impacts of increasing world electricity demands since, like nuclear fission power, they would not contribute to acid rain or the greenhouse effect. Fusion power could easily satisfy the energy needs associated with continued economic growth, given the ready availability of fuels. There would be no danger of a runaway fusion reaction as this is intrinsically impossible and any malfunction would result in a rapid shutdown of the plant.However, although fusion does not generate long-lived radioactive products and the unburned gases can be treated on site, there would a short- to medium-term radioactive waste problem due to activation of the structural materials. Some component materials will become radioactive during the lifetime of a reactor, due to bombardment with high-energy neutrons, and will eventually become radioactive waste. The volume of such waste would be similar to the corresponding volumes from fission reactors. However, the long-term radiotoxicity of the fusion wastes would be considerably lower than that from actinides in used fission fuel, and the activation product wastes would be handled in much the same way as those from fission reactors with some years of operation..There are also other concerns, principally regarding the possible release of tritium into the environment. It is radioactive and very difficult to contain since it can penetrate concrete, rubber and some grades of steel. As an isotope of hydrogen, it is easily incorporated into water, making the water itself weakly radioactive. With a half-life of about 12.3 years, the presence of tritium remains a threat to health for about 125 years after it is created, as a gas or in water, if at high levels. It can be inhaled, absorbed through the skin or ingested. Inhaled tritium spreads throughout the soft tissues and tritiated water mixes quickly with all the water in the body. Although there is only a small inventory of tritium in a fusion reactor – a few grams – each could conceivably release significant quantities of tritium during operation through routine leaks, assuming the best containment systems. An accident could release even more. This is one reason why long-term hopes are for the deuterium-deuterium fusion process, dispensing with tritium.While fusion power clearly has much to offer when the technology is eventually developed, the problems associated with it also need to be addressed if it is to become a widely used future energy source.* * *Notes & References------------------### Notesa. The nucleus of deuterium (D) consists of one proton and one neutron, whereas hydrogen only has one proton. Tritium (T) has one proton and two neutrons. When the nuclei of D and T fuse, helium-4 (two protons and two neutrons) is formed, along with a free neutron. The 17.6 MeV of energy released in the fusion reaction takes the form of kinetic energy, the helium having 3.5 MeV and the neutron 14.1 MeV. The products of the fusion reaction have a total mass that is slightly lower than the starting materials (D and T), this decrease in mass having been converted to energy according to E=mc2. ]b. Tritium can be produced by bombardment of lithium-6 with neutrons of any energy. When lithium-6 (three protons, three neutrons) absorbs a neutron it splits into helium (two protons, two neutrons) and tritium (one proton, two neutrons), along with the release of 4.8 MeV of energy. Tritium can also be produced from the more-abundant lithium-7 from high-energy neutrons. Hence, natural lithium can be used for tritium generation in a fusion reactor. According to the European Commission: \"A 1 GW (electric) fusion plant will need about 100 kg deuterium and 3 tons of natural lithium to operate for a whole year, generating about 7 billion kWh.\" ]c. The European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA) was established to provide a framework for magnetic confinement fusion research within the European Union and Switzerland. ]d. The Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory has a webpage on TFTR\\\\xa0]e. The first inertial confinement fusion experiments at NIF (see  will use the \\\\\\'indirect drive\\\\\\' method, which differs from the \\\\\\'direct drive\\\\\\' method described in the main text. In the indirect drive method, the lasers are focused on a gold cavity (known as a _hohlraum_) containing the fuel pellet. The lasers rapidly heat the inside surface of the hohlraum, generating X-rays that cause a blowoff of the capsule surface, in turn causing the fuel capsule to implode in the same way as if it had been hit with the lasers directly. It is hoped that NIF will be the first laser in which the energy released from the fusion fuel will exceed the laser energy used to produce the fusion reaction. ]f. Z machine was designed to supply X-ray pulses of 50 terawatts, but improvements allowed pulses of 290 terawatts. Following a major refurbishment in 2007, Z machine\\\\\\'s electrical pulse was increased from 18 million amps to 26 million amps delivered over a few nanoseconds. ]g.

(Image: A. Barber Huescar/IAEA)Newly released nuclear power data for 2023 collected by the IAEA, paint a picture of a clean energy technology at a crossroads amid the  to accelerate its deployment.Electricity production from nuclear power rose by 2.6 per cent last year compared to 2022, according to the operating data provided by IAEA Member States to the Power Reactor Information System (PRIS) — the IAEA’s comprehensive and publicly available database on nuclear power. Nuclear power continued to generate almost 10 percent of the world’s electricity and a quarter of all low carbon electricity last year, according to the data, which are featured in two newly released annual IAEA publications: Nuclear Power Reactors in the World () and Operating Experience with Nuclear Power Stations in Member States ().The USA remained the world’s top producer of nuclear electricity, followed by China and France. China continued to lead in newbuilds, beginning construction on five reactors. Newcomer Egypt started building its second reactor, according to the data, which showed the global fleet operating at nearly full strength with a median capacity factor of 88 per cent. While new grid connections were made at nuclear power plants in Belarus, China, Republic of Korea, Slovakia and the United States of America, reactors were shut down in Belgium, China and Germany.The 2023 data come against the backdrop of growing global ambitions for nuclear technology amid an aging reactor fleet. More than two-thirds of reactors are at least 30 years old. In December 2023, in the historic first Global Stocktake at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai, the 198 signatory countries to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change called for accelerating the deployment of low-emission energy technologies including nuclear power for deep and rapid decarbonization, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as industry. In addition, more than 20 countries at COP28 pledged to work towards tripling global nuclear power capacity to reach net zero by 2050.“IAEA data shows the global fleet of nuclear reactors continues to be a large and indispensable source of low-carbon electricity,” said IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi. “But it’s also clear that we will need to extend the lives of existing reactors, replace retiring facilities with new ones, and add a lot of new capacity so that global climate change and energy security goals can be reached.”]( Nuclear Power Development and Operating Experience Highlights------------------------------------------------------------------**Nuclear power status and trends**]( Taiwan, China - nuclear electricity produced:17.2 TWh, share of nuclear electricity produced: 6.9 per cent. Ukraine has not submitted 2023 data by the time of publication]( of the end of December 2023, global operational nuclear power capacity was 371.5 GW(e), provided by 413 reactors in 31 countries. However, only 403 reactors, with a combined capacity of 364.5 GW(e), reported their electricity production to the IAEA. Twenty-five reactors remained in suspended operations throughout the year, despite being licenced for operation. This includes four reactors in India with a combined net capacity of 639 MW(e) and 21 reactors in Japan with a combined net capacity of around 21 000 MW(e). Japan restarted two reactors in 2023, Takahama-1 and Takahama-2, which had been in suspended operation since 2011.Nuclear power capacity has remained at a consistent level over the past decade, with an additional 69.8 GW(e) nuclear capacity connected to the grid since the beginning of 2013. Over 79 per cent of this capacity growth occurred in Asia. China is still the fastest expanding nuclear power producer of the world, the reports on nuclear power reactors and operating experience show.China currently has 56 nuclear power reactors in operation and a further 27 reactors currently under construction.\\\\xa0Background----------The annual \\\\xa0 underscores the IAEA\\\\\\'s long-standing commitment as the custodian of the only officially collected and maintained data relating to nuclear power operating experience.

Small modular reactors (SMRs) — a cheaper, quicker-to-deploy alternative to the large nuclear power plants (LNPPs) that have traditionally dominated the sector — potentially offer a form of fossil fuel–free electricity that could help the world reach its emissions targets. However, a wide range of SMR designs exist or are in development — 68 are listed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) — and the lack of a dominant, proven model could curb commitments from utilities and investors.**Most SMR designs are being developed in the US, Russia, and China, but the sector is attracting companies from a large number of countries, even those with limited or no nuclear experience, such as Argentina and Poland. In a major signal of progress, Rolls-Royce was named in June 2025 as the preferred bidder by Great British Energy - Nuclear to build the UK’s first SMRs — a milestone that brings the promise of this technology closer to reality and underscores growing confidence in its commercial viability.An even wider range of nations is thinking about adopting SMR designs developed by other countries, with over 30 considering, planning, or starting new nuclear power programs, amid projections that meeting 2050 net zero targets may require up to 800 GW of new nuclear capacity — more than double what has been built over the last six decades.The designs gaining the most traction — along with the costs, regulatory conditions, and supply chains they will need to gain a solid foothold in the market — are summarized below and explored in full detail in the\\\\xa0.THE MAIN SMR DESIGNS--------------------SMRs are defined by the IAEA as having power capacity of up to 300 MWe, and broadly fall into two categories:1.  **Gen III/III+** — adaptations of existing LNPP designs that use light water as the coolant; they offer the market familiar, well-understood technology.\\\\xa0    2.  **Gen IV** — new designs that use different cooling sources, such as helium, molten salt, or molten metal (e.g., sodium and lead); these are untested technologies with limited to no operating experience.\\\\xa0    !!\\\\xa0SMR designs by typeThe coolants and fuels used in Gen IV reactors may enable them to operate at much higher temperatures than LNPPs without the need for significantly pressurized containment vessels. This would greatly improve safety — a key issue for nuclear power — and enable new industrial applications beyond low-emission power generation, including the production of green steel and ammonia.PROVING THE POTENTIAL OF SMRs-----------------------------A key advantage of SMRs is their modular, factory-based construction. Components are built using standardized processes, which cuts costs and deployment times compared with often bespoke LNPPs.However, to get SMRs into the market, the firms behind the technology need to prove that it is fit for purpose. While China and Russia have begun to produce power using SMRs, some promising projects elsewhere have faced setbacks. NuScale’s Idaho Falls project was cancelled in November 2023 due to growing concerns over cost overruns, construction delays, and a declining willingness among project stakeholders to bear the risks associated with FOAK development. This is because China and Russia have comparatively fewer regulatory hurdles, and Western utilities want to know that SMRs can work in jurisdictions with regulations and operating environments similar to their own before they commit.\\\\xa0We believe that only a handful of the currently active SMR designs will reach successful commercial deployment, but high uncertainty exists around which will prevail. What appears more certain is that whichever SMR manufacturer achieves the first successful deployment in the West will secure a significant competitive advantage.!!\\\\xa0Gen III+ design development!!\\\\xa0Gen IV design development  REACHING WIDESPREAD ADOPTION\\\\xa0-----------------------------Bringing an SMR to market will depend on more than just the manufacturer. An entire ecosystem of stakeholders, including energy companies, regulators, numerous firms along the supply chain, and investors will all be involved.The financial challenges companies face in rolling out SMRs means that governments must create strategies and legislation to help SMRs along the way. The Danish government’s work with the wind power sector provides a successful path — plans, tariffs, and R&D funding initiatives it put in place during the 1990s encouraged development of the industry, and wind power now produces 54% of Danish electricity, while the country boasts numerous world leaders in the sector.!!\\\\xa0Lessons for SMRs from comparable industriesThe costs SMRs will have to achieve to compete with other forms of baseload power will vary by country, with analysis showing the average cost of producing electricity over their lifetime needs to be between €52 €/MWh in Sweden and €119 €/MWh in Greece.For this to be attainable, SMRs and their components must be compatible with large-scale production to reach economies of scale. In terms of supply chains, SMR designs based on light water technology and that operate in a similar way to conventional reactors may have an advantage over Gen IV designs, as an extensive LNPP international supply chain already exists.However, while LNPPs are normally tailored to specific customer needs and local regulations, SMRs will rely on common, standardized components manufactured centrally and shipped to the construction site. This is a completely new concept in the nuclear industry that poses challenges for all SMRs. Its viability needs to be proven to win investor support.!!The price SMR must achieve to be competitive  TURNING PROMISE INTO PROGRESS-----------------------------The SMR market faces a classic “chicken and egg” dilemma. Many elements within the supply chain will not develop until long-term demand becomes clearer, yet SMR technology will not be deployed unless the supply chain supporting it is in place. Success requires everything to fall into place simultaneously.\\\\xa0A recent surge of investments has expanded the global SMR project pipeline by 65% since 2021, pointing to SMRs’ potential as an attractive value proposition. The industry and its ecosystem are clearly at a tipping point, with major progress toward commercialization. However, with no Western SMR near completion, the promise of this new nuclear technology still has a long way to go to become reality.!!Achieving this will require a coordinated push by the entire nuclear ecosystem, led and encouraged by governments through financial subsidies, supportive environments, and harmonized international guidelines. Only in this way will dominant SMR designs emerge, de-risking investments and enabling an industry that can safely deliver green power globally.\\\\xa0Download and read Arthur D.

This is because China and Russia have comparatively fewer regulatory hurdles, and Western utilities want to know that SMRs can work in jurisdictions with regulations and operating environments similar to their own before they commit.\\\\xa0We believe that only a handful of the currently active SMR designs will reach successful commercial deployment, but high uncertainty exists around which will prevail. What appears more certain is that whichever SMR manufacturer achieves the first successful deployment in the West will secure a significant competitive advantage.!!\\\\xa0Gen III+ design development!!\\\\xa0Gen IV design development  REACHING WIDESPREAD ADOPTION\\\\xa0-----------------------------Bringing an SMR to market will depend on more than just the manufacturer. An entire ecosystem of stakeholders, including energy companies, regulators, numerous firms along the supply chain, and investors will all be involved.The financial challenges companies face in rolling out SMRs means that governments must create strategies and legislation to help SMRs along the way. The Danish government’s work with the wind power sector provides a successful path — plans, tariffs, and R&D funding initiatives it put in place during the 1990s encouraged development of the industry, and wind power now produces 54% of Danish electricity, while the country boasts numerous world leaders in the sector.!!\\\\xa0Lessons for SMRs from comparable industriesThe costs SMRs will have to achieve to compete with other forms of baseload power will vary by country, with analysis showing the average cost of producing electricity over their lifetime needs to be between €52 €/MWh in Sweden and €119 €/MWh in Greece.For this to be attainable, SMRs and their components must be compatible with large-scale production to reach economies of scale. In terms of supply chains, SMR designs based on light water technology and that operate in a similar way to conventional reactors may have an advantage over Gen IV designs, as an extensive LNPP international supply chain already exists.However, while LNPPs are normally tailored to specific customer needs and local regulations, SMRs will rely on common, standardized components manufactured centrally and shipped to the construction site. This is a completely new concept in the nuclear industry that poses challenges for all SMRs. Its viability needs to be proven to win investor support.!!The price SMR must achieve to be competitive  TURNING PROMISE INTO PROGRESS-----------------------------The SMR market faces a classic “chicken and egg” dilemma. Many elements within the supply chain will not develop until long-term demand becomes clearer, yet SMR technology will not be deployed unless the supply chain supporting it is in place. Success requires everything to fall into place simultaneously.\\\\xa0A recent surge of investments has expanded the global SMR project pipeline by 65% since 2021, pointing to SMRs’ potential as an attractive value proposition. The industry and its ecosystem are clearly at a tipping point, with major progress toward commercialization. However, with no Western SMR near completion, the promise of this new nuclear technology still has a long way to go to become reality.!!Achieving this will require a coordinated push by the entire nuclear ecosystem, led and encouraged by governments through financial subsidies, supportive environments, and harmonized international guidelines. Only in this way will dominant SMR designs emerge, de-risking investments and enabling an industry that can safely deliver green power globally.\\\\xa0Download and read Arthur D.

The outlook for the industry is being transformed by climate change policies, shifting energy priorities and technological advances. But delivery of a new generation of nuclear facilities could be compromised unless lessons are learned from past projects and the nuclear sector’s endemic cost and schedule overruns.The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts 2025 will mark an all-time high for nuclear power generation as output increases in France, Japanese plants start up again after the pause following the 2011 Fukushima disaster, and commercial reactors begin operations in many markets, including Europe, China, India, and Korea.[1] the US too new output is coming online. The first new-builds in 30 years – Vogtle 3 and 4 in Georgia – have entered commercial service. The Palisades plant in Michigan is scheduled to come back online this year after a $2 billion upgrade following its closure in 2022.[2] US and other governments are supporting this nuclear comeback to meet increased electricity demand and climate goals. Although the new Trump administration has already made moves to drop other low-carbon policy initiatives and funding, nuclear plant licences have been extended, and nuclear projects usually command bipartisan support.[3] (and in some American states), climate policies will drive nuclear expansion. Nuclear energy must make a growing contribution – alongside renewables – if the world is to decarbonize electricity generation. In December 2023, more than 20 countries from four continents at the COP28 climate action summit in Dubai signed a declaration to triple nuclear capacity to achieve global net zero by 2050.[4] European Union has given nuclear power the ‘green’ light for funding to promote sustainability.[5] transition to clean energy is also enabling China – which plans to double its nuclear capacity by 2030 – to reduce air pollution from coal-powered plants in major cities. Other Asian countries face similar challenges.As coal is phased out, wind and solar power have become a bigger source of energy, but renewable energy is intermittent in the absence of large-scale battery storage. Nuclear can provide a reliable baseload supply. Having nuclear in the mix can also protect a nation’s energy security. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine highlighted Europe’s dependence on imported fossil fuels.Meanwhile, the electrification of transport and other industries, and the expansion of data centres running power-hungry AI is stoking demand. In 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that electricity consumption by data centres, AI and the cryptocurrency sector could double by 2026. Electrification needs to accelerate rapidly on the IEA’s pathway for net zero by 2050. Electricity’s share in final energy consumption, which was up from 18% in 2015 to 20% in 2023, would approach 30% in 2030.[6] Tech as well as some other industrial users and governments are willing to pay a premium for secure, low-carbon power. In the US, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have struck high-value purchase agreements with nuclear generators. The energy will be supplied by a mixture of currently operating and recommissioned plants and a new generation of small modular reactors (SMRs).[7] 20-year contract (with Constellation, America’s largest nuclear operator) will help restart a mothballed reactor at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania. The facility is expected to produce 835 megawatts of power to offset Microsoft’s data centre electricity needs.[8] and Google are also investing in start-ups developing SMRs,[9]\\\\xa0… Continue reading while Meta has released requests for proposals from providers of 1-4 gigawatts of nuclear generation capacity to power data centres needed for AI.### **SMRs – small, modular and repeatable?**With outputs up to 300 megawatts, SMRs promise a more flexible and affordable nuclear option for supplanting fossil fuel power stations. Conventional larger-scale nuclear reactors can be challenged by their upfront capital costs and construction timelines. Some are projecting that building SMRs could take less than half the construction time for large reactors.[10] Manufacturing modules in controlled factory settings may increase efficiency and assure quality. Modular designs also allow capacity to be increased incrementally, further reducing financing risk.Apart from American SMR-powered nuclear submarines, the first SMR units are already operating in China and Russia. As with solar and wind technology, China gained an advantage on the West in SMR nuclear technology, while Russia leads in SMR fuel production. The US government and companies have been investing in SMR technology to catch up.[11] countries – including Canada and the UK – are also backing SMR technology and its export potential.[12] Some years away from commercial scale, there are said to be more than 80 SMR designs using diverse technologies at different stages of development globally.[13] Demonstration projects later this decade could pave the way for a rollout of commercial SMR fleets beginning in the 2030s.[14] of SMRs believe that their smaller scale and simpler designs should allow standardization and cost-effective manufacturing and assembly. This product-based approach – modelled on ‘shipyard’ production – could improve cost and schedule performance.[15]### The case for caution in nuclear constructionOur global experience of major nuclear engineering and construction projects – and other sectors (including shipbuilding) – teaches caution.Early SMRs will be first-of-a-kind projects with the associated risks and uncertainties that entails. In 2023 the first planned SMR in the US was cancelled due to rising construction costs and an electricity price uncompetitive with wind and solar.[16] Costs and delays could arise as the industry adapts to new designs and processes. This may also apply to the new generation of ‘advanced nuclear reactors’ using futuristic technologies (that some SMRs may leverage), such as molten salt, high-temperature gas cooling and sodium cooling, and travelling wave designs.[17] shorter SMR construction schedules do not guarantee programme certainty. Building a downsized reactor is still a complex capital project. Units should be easier to deploy – on brownfield sites of retired coal-fired plants, for example, or off-grid to provide power or heat to industry. Every location has unique features that can challenge contractors, however., which analyses the incidence and causes of claims and disputes, confirms the comparatively poor record of nuclear projects. Over the seven-year timeframe to 2024, disputed costs averaged 62.8% of budgeted capital expenditure on 27 nuclear projects in seven countries. This was notably higher than for power stations fuelled by fossil fuels (74 projects in total, in 32 countries), which faced overruns of 40.7%.![]( extensions of time claimed by contractors were highest on European nuclear projects – averaging 74% of planned schedules, and three times longer than in the Middle East (the region with the longest overruns for all infrastructure and capital projects).[18]CRUX data for time extensions on US nuclear projects is not cited here as it includes claims for the additional costs of storing spent nuclear due to breach of contract over the federal\\\\xa0… Continue readingResultant distress may be higher, but most of the main causes of claims and disputes on nuclear projects are shared with other types of construction projects. Change in scope, the primary and near-universal driver of conflict in construction, was nearly twice as likely to affect nuclear projects (34.5%) as fossil power stations.Another, related cause was late design information (24.1%). Immature designs not only make conflicts and delays during construction more likely, they also make it difficult to verify cost estimates and schedules. Optimism bias is by no means unique to the nuclear sector, but unrealistic budgets and schedules and the significant overruns that result can derail projects.[19]National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2023. Laying the Foundation for New and Advanced Nuclear Reactors in the United States.  ### Learning the lessons of past failuresCosts have ballooned on EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) contracts for nuclear plant projects around the world. This has often arisen from the civil (non-nuclear) construction element, according to a 2023 US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report on new nuclear construction.[20]National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2023. Laying the Foundation for New and Advanced Nuclear Reactors in the United States. Global in scope, the report also noted that past studies had cited ‘negative learning for nuclear.’It is no surprise that most recurrent causes of conflict across the CRUX database of 2,000 projects are also prominent in the nuclear sector. Poor management of subcontractors and their interfaces affected almost one in four nuclear projects (24.1%); and clashes over contract interpretation even more (27.6%).Alleged bias or failure to cooperate was far more common in nuclear (17.2%) than fossil power (2.9%) projects, perhaps reflecting a greater cultural diversity of project partners, if not sheer complexity.Part of that complexity arises from the regulatory requirements around nuclear safety. CRUX indicates that nuclear projects were more likely to be affected by late approvals than fossil fuel power stations (20.7% vs. 8.8%) or all non-nuclear power projects(16.5%). Such delays may be due to the procedures of either/both employers and regulators. Inadequate responses to information requests were also notably more common in the nuclear sector than in the power sector as a whole (20.7% vs. 8.1%). However, poor interface management with third parties was blamed for disputes on a slightly smaller proportion of nuclear than non-nuclear power projects (10.3% vs. 13.2%).Some argue skills shortages are to be expected in an industry that has been stagnant for many years. The IEA identified investment in human capital as a priority for countries committing to nuclear growth. Utilities have generally not retained the staff needed to execute large nuclear projects. Many megaproject owners rely on outsourced technical expertise, and lack the capacity to oversee projects (which is not unique to the nuclear industry).[21]National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2023. Laying the Foundation for New and Advanced Nuclear Reactors in the United States. Much of the global construction industry suffers from skills gaps and problems with workmanship. The US, for example, has a shortfall in mechanical and electrical engineering talent, as well as critical trades such as welding.![]( More proactive reactor constructionAs much as $1.5 trillion could be invested in the nuclear renaissance through to 2050,[22] but the scale and unpredictability of construction costs remain a major obstacle. Citing past cost and schedule overruns, an investment analysis of the European nuclear market calls for new frameworks to mitigate the construction risks and attract capital.[23] CRUX research and some of the other evidence explored here point to some essential guardrails for new-build nuclear projects.At the outset, challenge sessions and war gaming can help crystallize the risks and choices for investors, promoters and other stakeholders. Independent checks of cost estimates and schedules by industry experts can mitigate optimism bias. The earlier the design is completed on a project, the fewer associated delays are likely to be encountered, and the greater chance the project will be delivered on time and budget.A proactive approach by project employers and fairly balanced allocation of risks among the parties will improve risk management and foster more productive working relationships with EPC contractors. Intelligent use of BIM (building information modelling) can enhance coordination and construction management. The potential benefits over the life cycle of both the project and operations may justify the creation of digital twins. During construction, comprehensive risk registers and robust project controls remain essential to keep projects on track.Notwithstanding new funding models, most nuclear projects worldwide rely on some level of government support – not only financial, but also to address skills shortages and regulatory risk. In the US, for example, the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act recognised the need to fund the training of a new generation of nuclear engineers and fill gaps in other project-critical professions and trades.Meanwhile, project teams can tailor design processes to align with regulation so that approvals overlap with design progress to minimise hold-ups. The ability to replicate proven SMRs should ease this regulatory burden. International efforts to streamline and harmonise design certification are also encouraging.[24] the project level, a proactive approach to engineering and construction will be needed to mitigate risk and avoid past pitfalls, enabling cost-effective delivery of the nuclear renaissance.### About the authorKim Reome is a specialist in damages analysis in the construction and electric utility industries with over 30 years’ experience.

(Photo: D. Calma/IAEA)There is growing global interest in nuclear energy, and countries are acting on this interest. In the opening session of the Scientific Forum, the President of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo, shared his plans for the inclusion of nuclear energy in the country’s electricity generation mix. “We’re committed to a clean, equitable energy transition that harnesses the full potential of all low carbon sources, including nuclear power,” President Akufo-Addo said. “Nuclear power will play a significant part in this transformation.”\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Ghana is analysing small modular reactors (SMRs) and their potential for rapid deployment for clean and affordable energy. “We are working with industry experts to study the feasibility of deploying this new technology in Ghana,” President Akufo-Addo said.\\\\xa0In the United States of America, where nuclear power provides the single largest source of clean energy, “reaching our 2050 net zero goals depends on at least tripling our nuclear energy capacity to 300 gigawatts or more,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm. The US Government has invested “billions of dollars in the future of nuclear energy, creating historic tax incentives for investments in new facilities and production of nuclear energy,” and the development of a domestic fuel supply chain is underway, she added\\\\xa0\\\\xa0The US Department of Energy recently released , a set of reports to accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies, including advanced nuclear reactors. Advanced reactors are key to reaching net zero goals because they can help to decarbonize energy intensive industries, such as hydrogen production, desalination, district heating, petroleum refining and fertilizer production, Secretary Granholm said. She encouraged more countries to look at nuclear energy as a sustainable, long term investment and to harness “the power of the atom for a new era of peace and prosperity in what is potentially the greatest peace project of our time – a net zero world.”\\\\xa0The Republic of Korea is also investing in growing its nuclear sector. Since 2000, Korea has been implementing its Nuclear Power System Development Plan, with a specific focus on developing advanced reactors, and as a result, in 2012, Korea’s first SMR – SMART – received the standard design approval from the Korean regulator, said Lee Jong-Ho, Minister of Science and ICT in the Republic of Korea. “Now we are developing an even more advanced and innovative SMR based on SMART technology,” he added.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0The Korean Government believes that the private sector should take the lead in technological innovations. “This is especially true for the SMR sector, which aims to replace fossil fuels in industries such as seawater desalination and space exploration,” Minister Jong-Ho said. The Korean Government is launching the Korea SMR Initiative to transfer SMART and other advanced nuclear technologies to the private sector in order to help demonstrate and commercialize new reactors. “To kick start these efforts, starting next year, the Government will collaborate with the relevant companies to invest in developing high temperature gas reactors designed for industrial process heat with applications such as hydrogen production and other uses,” he said.\\\\xa0In Morocco, the Government is considering adding nuclear power to its energy mix to ensure a reliable energy supply. “Morocco places a distinct focus on small modular reactors due to their numerous advantages, including the flexibility for integration,” said Leila Benali, Morocco’s Minister of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development, in a video statement to the Forum. “They hold significant promise for diverse applications, such as combined heat and power generation and seawater desalination.”\\\\xa0Minister Benali also announced that Morocco’s National Centre for Nuclear Energy, Sciences and Technology has been designated as an , enabling it to function as a global learning platform. “Morocco\\\\\\'s national infrastructure that is now reinforced by this recognition is open for the benefit of the African continent with a focus on capacity building,” she said.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0For the past 40 years, Sweden has expanded different forms of renewable energy, with wind power providing a significant share of electricity, and biomass replacing oil and coal for district heating and industrial processes. “What was forgotten, though, was that the power system is very sensitive and that it has to work technically. It\\\\\\'s not just about adding terawatt hours,” said Sweden’s Vice Minister for Climate and the Environment, Daniel Westlén. Considering the requirement for dispatchable energy to meet demand, when and where needed, as well as for demand to be met without carbon emissions, the options are limited. “Nuclear energy is the only option available,” he added.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0To reach climate and net zero goals, studies have estimated a doubling or tripling of nuclear energy capacity by 2050. “Can the world build 20 or even 40 gigawatts of nuclear energy per year? I would claim it is possible. We’ve done it before,” Vice Minister Westlén said. In the 1980s, more than 180 reactors were under construction globally, and more than 30 gigawatts were added in one single year, he explained. Sweden deployed 12 large reactors between 1972 and 1985.

By 2035, China expects to build 150 new nuclear reactors. “We have so many coal-fired power stations that must be replaced by nuclear power,” said Yu Jianfeng,\\\\u202fChairman of China National Nuclear Corporation, during the closing session of the Forum on Wednesday.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0In the United Kingdom, “we have an ambitious target of 24 gigawatts of nuclear power to be on the UK grid by 2050,” said Andrew Bowie, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and Minister for Nuclear and Networks. “As vital as it is to decarbonize our energy baseload, it is also about prices – the cost of living, affordable energy, and being energy secure and independent.”\\\\xa0\\\\xa0When it comes to prices, Finland’s Minister of Climate and Environment, Kai Mykkänen, told the Forum that Finland’s Olkiluoto 3, Europe’s largest nuclear reactor at 1.6 gigawatts, has led to the lowest electricity prices in Finland in years. Olkiluoto 3, which began regular output in April, is the key reason Finland has ceased direct electricity and natural gas imports, while simultaneously lowering electricity prices, he said.\\\\xa0Public acceptance, as well as financing, surrounding nuclear power must also be considered in the path forward. “We have to interact with society to ensure the technical solutions we propose will be, in the end, accepted,” said Peter Baeten, Director General of the Belgian Nuclear Research Center SCK CEN. Furthermore, while technical innovation is essential, there are other aspects of innovation, said Sama Bilbao,\\\\u202fDirector General of World Nuclear Association. “We need innovation in the way we finance new nuclear. We need to think outside the box to attract investment into these nuclear projects,” she added.\\\\xa0Given the speed and scale of innovation within the nuclear field, Director General Grossi is optimistic. “There are challenges, but it is clear – we are moving decisively. We are moving, perhaps, at different paces and in different ways,” he said. “The end result will not be uniform because there is not a one-size-fits-all solution. But we can see how nuclear is very firmly positioned in this global effort that is taking place now.”\\\\xa0\\\\xa0![]( closing session of the Scientific Forum at the IAEA 67th General Conference held at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, Austria, 27 September 2023.

(Photo: D. Calma/IAEA)There is growing global interest in nuclear energy, and countries are acting on this interest. In the opening session of the Scientific Forum, the President of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo, shared his plans for the inclusion of nuclear energy in the country’s electricity generation mix. “We’re committed to a clean, equitable energy transition that harnesses the full potential of all low carbon sources, including nuclear power,” President Akufo-Addo said. “Nuclear power will play a significant part in this transformation.”\\xa0\\xa0Ghana is analysing small modular reactors (SMRs) and their potential for rapid deployment for clean and affordable energy. “We are working with industry experts to study the feasibility of deploying this new technology in Ghana,” President Akufo-Addo said.\\xa0In the United States of America, where nuclear power provides the single largest source of clean energy, “reaching our 2050 net zero goals depends on at least tripling our nuclear energy capacity to 300 gigawatts or more,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm. The US Government has invested “billions of dollars in the future of nuclear energy, creating historic tax incentives for investments in new facilities and production of nuclear energy,” and the development of a domestic fuel supply chain is underway, she added\\xa0\\xa0The US Department of Energy recently released , a set of reports to accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies, including advanced nuclear reactors. Advanced reactors are key to reaching net zero goals because they can help to decarbonize energy intensive industries, such as hydrogen production, desalination, district heating, petroleum refining and fertilizer production, Secretary Granholm said. She encouraged more countries to look at nuclear energy as a sustainable, long term investment and to harness “the power of the atom for a new era of peace and prosperity in what is potentially the greatest peace project of our time – a net zero world.”\\xa0The Republic of Korea is also investing in growing its nuclear sector. Since 2000, Korea has been implementing its Nuclear Power System Development Plan, with a specific focus on developing advanced reactors, and as a result, in 2012, Korea’s first SMR – SMART – received the standard design approval from the Korean regulator, said Lee Jong-Ho, Minister of Science and ICT in the Republic of Korea. “Now we are developing an even more advanced and innovative SMR based on SMART technology,” he added.\\xa0\\xa0The Korean Government believes that the private sector should take the lead in technological innovations. “This is especially true for the SMR sector, which aims to replace fossil fuels in industries such as seawater desalination and space exploration,” Minister Jong-Ho said. The Korean Government is launching the Korea SMR Initiative to transfer SMART and other advanced nuclear technologies to the private sector in order to help demonstrate and commercialize new reactors. “To kick start these efforts, starting next year, the Government will collaborate with the relevant companies to invest in developing high temperature gas reactors designed for industrial process heat with applications such as hydrogen production and other uses,” he said.\\xa0In Morocco, the Government is considering adding nuclear power to its energy mix to ensure a reliable energy supply. “Morocco places a distinct focus on small modular reactors due to their numerous advantages, including the flexibility for integration,” said Leila Benali, Morocco’s Minister of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development, in a video statement to the Forum. “They hold significant promise for diverse applications, such as combined heat and power generation and seawater desalination.”\\xa0Minister Benali also announced that Morocco’s National Centre for Nuclear Energy, Sciences and Technology has been designated as an , enabling it to function as a global learning platform. “Morocco\\'s national infrastructure that is now reinforced by this recognition is open for the benefit of the African continent with a focus on capacity building,” she said.\\xa0\\xa0For the past 40 years, Sweden has expanded different forms of renewable energy, with wind power providing a significant share of electricity, and biomass replacing oil and coal for district heating and industrial processes. “What was forgotten, though, was that the power system is very sensitive and that it has to work technically. It\\'s not just about adding terawatt hours,” said Sweden’s Vice Minister for Climate and the Environment, Daniel Westlén. Considering the requirement for dispatchable energy to meet demand, when and where needed, as well as for demand to be met without carbon emissions, the options are limited. “Nuclear energy is the only option available,” he added.\\xa0\\xa0To reach climate and net zero goals, studies have estimated a doubling or tripling of nuclear energy capacity by 2050. “Can the world build 20 or even 40 gigawatts of nuclear energy per year? I would claim it is possible. We’ve done it before,” Vice Minister Westlén said. In the 1980s, more than 180 reactors were under construction globally, and more than 30 gigawatts were added in one single year, he explained. Sweden deployed 12 large reactors between 1972 and 1985. While “climate change is the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced… we are in possession of the tools that we will need to solve this,” he concluded.\\xa0Last year, French President Emmanuel Macron announced a programme to build six nuclear reactors, as well as a programme dedicated to nuclear and innovation with small and advanced modular reactors. “We need energy, which is at the same time cheap, affordable and sustainable.

Initially, fusion research in the USA and USSR was linked to atomic weapons development, and it remained classified until the 1958 Atoms for Peace conference in Geneva. Following a breakthrough at the Soviet tokamak, fusion research became \\'big science\\' in the 1970s. But the cost and complexity of the devices involved increased to the point where international co-operation was the only way forward.\\xa0The Fusion Industry Association report \")\\xa0said that $2.83 billion of new investment was declared by private nuclear fusion companies since the 2021 edition of the report.Fusion powers the Sun and stars as hydrogen atoms fuse together to form helium, and matter is converted into energy. Hydrogen, heated to very high temperatures changes from a gas to a plasma in which the negatively-charged electrons are separated from the positively-charged atomic nuclei (ions). Normally, fusion is not possible because the strongly repulsive electrostatic forces between the positively charged nuclei prevent them from getting close enough together to collide and for fusion to occur. However, if the conditions are such that the nuclei can overcome the electrostatic forces to the extent that they can come within a very close range of each other, then the attractive nuclear force (which binds protons and neutrons together in atomic nuclei) between the nuclei will outweigh the repulsive (electrostatic) force, allowing the nuclei to fuse together. Such conditions can occur when the temperature increases, causing the ions to move faster and eventually reach speeds high enough to bring the ions close enough together. The nuclei can then fuse, causing a release of energy.Fusion technology-----------------In the Sun, massive gravitational forces create the right conditions for fusion, but on Earth they are much harder to achieve. Fusion fuel – different isotopes of hydrogen – must be heated to extreme temperatures of the order of 50 million degrees Celsius, and must be kept stable under intense pressure, hence dense enough and confined for long enough to allow the nuclei to fuse. The aim of the controlled fusion research program is to achieve \\'ignition\\', which occurs when enough fusion reactions take place for the process to become self-sustaining, with fresh fuel then being added to continue it.\\xa0Once ignition is achieved, there is net energy yield – about four times as much as with nuclear fission. According to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the amount of power produced increases with the square of the pressure, so doubling the pressure leads to a fourfold increase in energy production.With current technology, the reaction most readily feasible is between the nuclei of the two heavy forms (isotopes) of hydrogen – deuterium (D) and tritium (T). Each D-T fusion event releases 17.6 MeV (2.8 x 10-12 joule, compared with 200 MeV for a U-235 fission and 3-4 MeV for D-D fusion). On a mass basis, the D-T fusion reaction releases over four times as much energy as uranium fission. Deuterium occurs naturally in seawater (30 grams per cubic metre), which makes it very abundant relative to other energy resources. Tritium occurs naturally only in trace quantities (produced by cosmic rays) and is radioactive, with a half-life of around 12 years. Usable quantities can be made in a conventional nuclear reactor, or in the present context, bred in a fusion system from lithium. Lithium is found in large quantities (30 parts per million) in the Earth\\'s crust and in weaker concentrations in the sea.In a fusion reactor, the concept is that neutrons generated from the D-T fusion reaction will be absorbed in a blanket containing lithium which surrounds the core. The lithium is then transformed into tritium (which is used to fuel the reactor) and helium. The blanket must be thick enough (about 1 metre) to slow down the\\xa0high-energy (14 MeV) neutrons. The kinetic energy of the neutrons is absorbed by the blanket, causing it to heat up. The heat energy is collected by the coolant (water, helium or Li-Pb eutectic) flowing through the blanket and, in a fusion power plant, this energy will be used to generate electricity by conventional methods.\\xa0If insufficient tritium is produced, some supplementary source must be employed such as using a fission reactor to irradiate heavy water or lithium with neutrons, and extraneous tritium creates difficulties with handling, storage and transport.The difficulty has been to develop a device that can heat the D-T fuel to a high enough temperature and confine it long enough so that more energy is released through fusion reactions than is used to get the reaction going. While the D-T reaction is the main focus of attention, long-term hopes are for a D-D reaction, but this requires much higher temperatures.In any case, the challenge is to apply the heat to human needs, primarily generating electricity. The energy density of fusion reactions in gas is very much less than for fission reactions in solid fuel, and as noted the heat yield per reaction is 70 times less. Hence thermonuclear fusion will always have a much lower power density than nuclear fission, which means that any fusion reactor needs to be larger and therefore more costly, than a fission reactor of the same power output. In addition, nuclear fission reactors use solid fuel which is denser than a thermonuclear plasma, so the energy released is more concentrated.\\xa0Also the neutron energy from fusion is higher than from fission – 14.1 MeV instead of about 2 MeV, which presents significant challenges regarding structural materials.At present, two main experimental approaches are being studied: magnetic confinement and inertial confinement. The first method uses strong magnetic fields to contain the hot plasma. The second involves compressing a small pellet containing fusion fuel to extremely high densities using strong lasers or particle beams.\\xa0A range of magnetized target fusion systems are also being developed, along with experiments with hybrid fusion.### Magnetic confinementIn magnetic confinement fusion (MCF), hundreds of cubic metres of D-T plasma at a density of less than a milligram per cubic metre are confined by a magnetic field at a few atmospheres pressure and heated to fusion temperature.Magnetic fields are ideal for confining a plasma because the electrical charges on the separated ions and electrons mean that they follow the magnetic field lines. The aim is to prevent the particles from coming into contact with the reactor walls as this will dissipate their heat and slow them down. The most effective magnetic configuration is toroidal, shaped like a doughnut, in which the magnetic field is curved around to form a closed loop. For proper confinement, this toroidal field must have superimposed upon it a perpendicular field component (a poloidal field). The result is a magnetic field with force lines following spiral (helical) paths that confine and control the plasma.There are several types of toroidal confinement system, the most important being tokamaks, stellarators and reversed field pinch (RFP) devices.In a tokamak, the toroidal field is created by a series of coils evenly spaced around the torus-shaped reactor, and the poloidal field is created by a system of horizontal coils outside the toroidal magnet structure. A strong electric current is induced in the plasma using a central solenoid, and this induced current also contributes to the poloidal field. In a stellarator, the helical lines of force are produced by a series of coils which may themselves be helical in shape. Unlike tokamaks, stellarators do not require a toroidal current to be induced in the plasma. RFP devices have the same toroidal and poloidal components as a tokamak, but the current flowing through the plasma is much stronger and the direction of the toroidal field within the plasma is reversed.In tokamaks and RFP devices, the current flowing through the plasma also serves to heat it to a temperature of about 10 million degrees Celsius. Beyond that, additional heating systems are needed to achieve the temperatures necessary for fusion. In stellarators, these heating systems have to supply all the energy needed.The tokamak (_toroidalnya kamera ee magnetnaya katushka_ – torus-shaped magnetic chamber) was designed in 1951 by Soviet physicists Andrei Sakharov and Igor Tamm. Tokamaks operate within limited parameters outside which sudden losses of energy confinement (disruptions) can occur, causing major thermal and mechanical stresses to the structure and walls. Nevertheless, it is considered the most promising design, and research is continuing on various tokamaks around the world.Research is also being carried out on several types of stellarator. Lyman Spitzer devised and began work on the first fusion device – a stellarator – at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory in 1951. Due to the difficulty in confining plasmas, stellarators fell out of favour until computer modelling techniques allowed accurate geometries to be calculated. Because stellarators have no toroidal plasma current, plasma stability is increased compared with tokamaks. Since the burning plasma can be more easily controlled and monitored, stellerators have an intrinsic potential for steady-state, continuous operation. The disadvantage is that, due to their more complex shape, stellarators are much more complex than tokamaks to design and build.RFP devices differ from tokamaks mainly in the spatial distribution of the toroidal magnetic field, which changes sign at the edge of the plasma. The RFX machine in Padua, Italy is used to study the physical problems arising from the spontaneous reorganization of the magnetic field, which is an intrinsic feature of this configuration.### Inertial confinementIn inertial confinement fusion, which is a newer line of research, laser or ion beams are focused very precisely onto the surface of a target, which is a pellet of D-T fuel, a few millimetres in diameter. This heats the outer layer of the material, which explodes outwards generating an inward-moving compression front or implosion that compresses and heats the inner layers of material. The core of the fuel may be compressed to one thousand times its liquid density, resulting in conditions where fusion can occur. The energy released then would heat the surrounding fuel, which may also undergo fusion leading to a chain reaction (known as ignition) as the reaction spreads outwards through the fuel. The time required for these reactions to occur is limited by the inertia of the fuel (hence the name), but is less than a microsecond. So far, most inertial confinement work has involved lasers.Recent work at Osaka University\\'s Institute of Laser Engineering in Japan suggests that ignition may be achieved at lower temperature with a second very intense laser pulse guided through a millimetre-high gold cone into the compressed fuel, and timed to coincide with the peak compression. This technique, known as \\'fast ignition\\', means that fuel compression is separated from hot spot generation with ignition, making the process more practical.In the UK  based near Oxford is researching inertial fusion energy (IFE) with a focus on power driver technology using an asymmetric implosion approach. As well as power generation, the company envisages material processing and chemical manufacturing applications. In March 2025 the company announced that it would focus on providing its amplifier technology, dropping earlier plans to develop a power plant.The US  is a large laser-based inertial confinement fusion research device at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. It focuses 192 powerful laser beams into a small target in a few billionths of a second, delivering more than 2 MJ of ultraviolet energy and 500 TW of peak power.A completely different concept, the \\'Z-pinch\\' (or \\'zeta pinch\\'), uses a strong electrical current in a plasma to generate X-rays, which compress a tiny D-T fuel cylinder.### Magnetized target fusionMagnetized target fusion (MTF), also referred to as magneto-inertial fusion (MIF), is a pulsed approach to fusion that combines the compressional heating of inertial confinement fusion with the magnetically reduced thermal transport and magnetically enhanced alpha heating of magnetic confinement fusion.A range of MTF systems are currently being experimented with, and commonly use a magnetic field to confine a plasma with compressional heating provided by laser, electromagnetic or mechanical liner implosion. As a result of this combined approach, shorter plasma confinement times are required than for magnetic confinement (from 100 ns to 1 ms, depending on the MIF approach), reducing the requirement to stabilize the plasma for long periods. Conversely, compression can be achieved over timescales longer than those typical for inertial confinement, making it possible to achieve compression through mechanical, magnetic, chemical, or relatively low-powered laser drivers.Several approaches are underway to examine MTF, including experiments at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratory, the University of Rochester, and private companies General Fusion and Helion Energy.R&D challenges for MTF include whether a suitable target plasma can be formed and heated to fusion conditions while avoiding contamination from the liner, as with magnetic confinement and inertial confinement. Due to the reduced demands on confinement time and compression velocities, MTF has been pursued as a lower-cost and simpler approach to investigating these challenges than conventional fusion projects.In the UK General Fusion\\'s  at the UK Atomic Energy Authority\\'s Culham Campus, near Oxford, received planning consent for construction in January 2022. The company aims to construct a fusion energy power plant by the early 2030s.### Hybrid fusionFusion can also be combined with fission in what is referred to as hybrid nuclear fusion where the blanket surrounding the core is a subcritical fission reactor. The fusion reaction acts as a source of neutrons for the surrounding blanket, where these neutrons are captured, resulting in fission reactions taking place. These fission reactions would also produce more neutrons, thereby assisting further fission reactions in the blanket.The concept of hybrid fusion can be compared with an accelerator-driven system (ADS), where an accelerator is the source of neutrons for the blanket assembly, rather than nuclear fusion reactions (see page on ). The blanket of a hybrid fusion system can therefore contain the same fuel as an ADS – for example, the abundant element thorium or the long-lived heavy isotopes present in used nuclear fuel (from a conventional reactor) could be used as fuel.The blanket containing fission fuel in a hybrid fusion system would not require the development of new materials capable of withstanding constant neutron bombardment, whereas such materials would be needed in the blanket of a \\'conventional\\' fusion system. A further advantage of a hybrid system is that the fusion part would not need to produce as many neutrons as a (non-hybrid) fusion reactor would in order to generate more power than is consumed – so a commercial-scale fusion reactor in a hybrid system does not need to be as large as a fusion-only reactor.Fusion research---------------A long-standing quip about fusion points out that, since the 1970s, commercial deployment of fusion power has always been about 40 years away. While there is some truth in this, many breakthroughs have been made, particularly in recent years, and there are a number of major projects under development that may bring research to the point where fusion power can be commercialized.Several **tokamaks** have been built, including the Joint European Torus (JET)\\xa0and the Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak (MAST)\\xa0in the UK and the tokamak fusion test reactor (TFTR) at Princeton in the USA. The ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) project currently under construction in Cadarache, France will be the largest tokamak when it operates in the 2020s. The Chinese Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR) is a tokamak which is reported to be larger than ITER, and due for completion in 2030.\\xa0Meanwhile it is running its Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST). In the UK, Tokamak Energy has commissioned and is further developing its ST40 tokamak.\\xa0In March 2022 the US Department of Energy announced up to $50 million of federal funding to support US scientists conducting experimental research in fusion energy science. $20 million of this would support tokamak facilities, while the other $30 million would support\\xa0research to improve fusion performance and increase the duration of burning plasma scenarios.Much research has also been carried out on **stellarators**. A large one of these, the Large Helical Device at Japan\\'s National Institute of Fusion Research, began operating in 1998. It is being used to study the best magnetic configuration for plasma confinement. At the Garching site of the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Germany, research carried out at the Wendelstein 7-AS between 1988 and 2002 is being progressed at the Wendelstein 7-X, which was built over 19 years at Max Planck Institute\\'s Greifswald site and started up at the end of 2015. Another stellarator, TJII, is in operation in Madrid, Spain. In the USA, at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, where the first stellarators were built in 1951, construction on the NCSX stellerator was abandoned in 2008 due to cost overruns and lack of funding.There have also been significant developments in research into **inertial fusion energy** (IFE). Construction of the\\xa0$7 billion National Ignition Facility (NIF) at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), funded by the National Nuclear Security Administration, was completed in March 2009. The Laser Mégajoule (LMJ) in France’s Bordeaux region started operation in October 2014. Both are designed to deliver, in a few billionths of a second, nearly two million joules of light energy to targets measuring a few millimeters in size. The main purpose of both NIF and LMJ is\\xa0for research to support both countries\\' respective\\xa0nuclear weapons programs.In September 2021 the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) opened the Fusion Technology Facility at the Advanced Manufacturing Park in Rotherham. It will house test rigs including the Combined Heating and Magnetic Research Apparatus (CHIMERA), which would be the only device capable of\\xa0simulating\\xa0conditions of a fusion power plant to test prototype components.### ITERIn 1985, the Soviet Union suggested building a next generation tokamak with Europe, Japan and the USA. Collaboration was established under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Between 1988 and 1990, the initial designs were drawn up for an International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER, which also means \\'a path\\' or \\'journey\\' in Latin) with the aim of proving that fusion could produce useful energy. The four parties agreed in 1992 to collaborate further on engineering design activities for ITER. Canada and Kazakhstan are also involved through Euratom and Russia, respectively.Six years later, the ITER Council approved the first comprehensive design of a fusion reactor based on well-established physics and technology with a price tag of $6 billion. Then the USA decided pull out of the project, forcing a 50% reduction in costs and a redesign. The result was the ITER Fusion Energy Advanced Tokomak (ITER-FEAT) – initially expected to cost $3 billion but still achieve the targets of a self-sustaining reaction and a net energy gain. The envisaged energy gain is unlikely to be enough for a power plant, but it should demonstrate feasibility.In 2003, the USA rejoined the project and China also announced it would join. After deadlocked discussion, the six partners agreed in mid-2005 to site ITER at Cadarache, in southern France. The deal involved major concessions to Japan, which had put forward Rokkasho as a preferred site. The European Union (EU) and France would contribute half of the then estimated €12.8 billion total cost, with the other partners – Japan, China, South Korea, USA and Russia – putting in 10% each. Japan will provide a lot of the high-tech components, will host a €1 billion materials testing facility – the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF) – and will have the right to host a subsequent demonstration fusion reactor. India became the seventh member of the ITER consortium at the end of 2005. In November 2006, the seven members – China, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea, the USA and the European Union – signed the ITER implementing agreement.\\xa0The total cost of the 500 MW ITER comprises about half for the ten-year construction and half for 20 years of operation.Site preparation works at Cadarache commenced in January 2007. First concrete for the buildings was poured in December 2013. Experiments were due to begin in 2018, when hydrogen will be used to avoid activating the magnets, but this is now expected in 2035. The first D-T plasma is not expected until 2035.\\xa0ITER is large because confinement time increases with the cube of machine size. The vacuum vessel will be 19 m across and 11 m high, and weigh more than 5000 tonnes.The goal of ITER is to operate with a plasma thermal output of 500 MW (for at least 400 seconds continuously) with less than 50 MW of plasma heating power input. No electricity will be generated at ITER.An associated CEA facility at Cadarache is WEST, formerly Tore Supra, which is designed to test prototype components and accelerate their development for ITER. It is focused on the divertor structure to remove helium, testing the durability of tungsten materials used.A 2 GW Demonstration Power Plant, known as Demo, is expected to demonstrate large-scale production of electrical power on a continual basis. The conceptual design of Demo was expected to be completed by 2017, with construction beginning around 2024 and the first phase of operation commencing from 2033. It has since been delayed, with construction now planned for after 2040.In November 2022 it was announced that a defect had been discovered in the thermal shields and vacuum vessel of ITER. The bending and welding of cooling fluid in pipes to the thermal shield panels\\xa0resulted in stress corrosion cracking of up to 2.2mm deep in the pipes. Due to the risk of leaking, the installed module will\\xa0need to be lifted out and disassembled\\xa0in order to proceed with the repairs. ITER director general Pietro Barabaschi\\xa0said the consequences on schedule and cost \"will not be insignificant\". In March 2025 the manufacturing of the second vaccum vessel was completed.### JETIn 1978, the European Community (Euratom, along with Sweden and Switzerland) launched the Joint European Torus (JET) project in the UK. JET is the largest tokamak operating in the world today. A similar tokamak, JT-60, operates at the Naka Fusion Institute of Japan Atomic Energy Agency in Japan, but only JET has the facilities to use D-T fuel.Following a legal dispute with Euratom, in December 1999 JET\\'s international contract ended and the UKAEA\\xa0took over the management of JET on behalf of its European partners. From that time JET\\'s experimental programme has been co-ordinated by the European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA) parties.\\xa0JET is operated by the UKAEA\\'s Culham Centre for Fusion Research, a member of the EUROfusion consortium.JET produced its first plasma in 1983, and became the first experiment to produce controlled fusion power in November 1991, albeit with high input of electricity. Up to 16 MW of fusion power for one second and 5 MW sustained has been achieved in D-T plasmas using the device, from 24 MW of power injected into its heating system, and many experiments are conducted to study different heating schemes and other techniques. JET has been very successful in operating remote handling techniques in a radioactive environment to modify the interior of the device and has shown that the remote handling maintenance of fusion devices is realistic.JET is a key device in preparations for ITER. It has been significantly upgraded in recent years to test ITER plasma physics and engineering systems. Further enhancements are planned at JET with a view to exceeding its fusion power record in future D-T experiments. A compact device – Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak (MAST) – was developed alongside JET at Culham, partly to serve the ITER project, and the substantial\\xa0MAST Upgrade\\xa0project is now being implemented in stages to increase neutral beam power from 5 to 12.5 MW and the energy deposited in plasma from 2.5 to 30 MJ. MAST Upgrade is focused on designing a plasma exhaust system or divertor that would be able withstand the intense power loads created in commercial-sized fusion reactors. It achieved first plasma in October 2020.In 2019 the UK government committed £22 million over four years for the conceptual design of the Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP) at Culham. The technical objectives of STEP are: to deliver predictable net electricity greater than 100 MW; to exploit fusion energy beyond electricity production; to ensure tritium self-sufficiency; to qualify materials and components under appropriate fusion conditions of neutron flux; and to develop a viable path to affordable life-cycle costs. STEP is scheduled for completion in 2040.\\xa0In February 2022 researchers at JET achieved 59 megajoules of heat energy from fusion over a five-second period, doubling previous records.### Tokamak EnergyTokamak Energy in the UK is a private company developing a spherical tokamak, and hopes to commercialize this by 2030. The company grew out of Culham laboratory, home to JET, and its technology revolves around high temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets, which allow for relatively low-power and small-size devices, but high performance and potentially widespread commercial deployment. Its first tokamak with exclusively HTS magnets\\xa0– the ST25 HTS, Tokamak Energy\\'s second reactor\\xa0– demonstrated 29 hours\\' continuous plasma during the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition in London in 2015, a world record.The next reactor is the ST40 at Milton Park in Oxfordshire, which achieved first plasma in April 2017. It produced plasma temperatures of 15 million degrees Celsius in 2018 and 2019 after the commissioning of further magnetic coils. Chief executive of Tokamak Energy David Kingham said: \"The ST40 is designed to achieve 100 million degrees C and get within a factor of ten of energy break-even conditions.” The company is working with Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory on spherical tokamaks, and with the Plasma Science and Fusion Centre at MIT on HTS magnets.\\xa0In July 2020 it was awarded £10 million from the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), as part of the government’s Advanced Modular Reactor project. The funds will contribute to core development work on high temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets and plasma exhaust system (divertor) technologies. The divertor must handle high levels of heat and particle bombardment while removing impurities and waste from the system. It aims to have a prototype delivering electricity to the grid by 2030.### KSTARThe KSTAR (Korean Superconducting Tokamak Reactor) at the National Fusion Research Institute (NFRI) in Daejeon produced its first plasma in mid-2008. It is a pilot device for ITER, and involves much international collaboration. It will be a satellite of ITER during ITER’s operational phase. The tokamak with 1.8 metre major radius is the first to use Nb3Sn superconducting magnets, the same material to be used in the ITER project. Its first stage of development to 2012 was to prove baseline operation technologies and achieved plasma pulses of up to 20 seconds. For the second phase of development (2013-2017), KSTAR was upgraded to study long pulses of up to 300 seconds in H mode – the 100s target was in 2015 – and embark upon high-performance AT mode. It achieved 70 seconds in high-performance plasma operation in late 2016, a world record. In addition, KSTAR researchers also succeeded in achieving an alternative advanced plasma operation mode with the internal transport barrier (ITB). This is a steep pressure gradient in the core of the plasmas due to the enhanced core plasma confinement. NFRI said this is the first ITB operation achieved in the superconducting device at the lowest heating power. KSTAR Phase 3 (2018-2023) is to develop high performance, high efficiency AT mode technologies with long-pulse operation. Phase 4 (2023-2025) will test DEMO-related prior arts. The device does not have tritium handling capabilities, so will not use D-T fuel.### K-DEMO tokamakIn collaboration with the US Department of Energy\\'s Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) in New Jersey and South Korea’s National Fusion Research Institute (NFRI) K-DEMO is intended to be the next step toward commercial reactors from ITER, and would be the first plant to actually contribute power to an electric grid. According to the PPPL, it would generate \"some 1 billion watts of power for several weeks on end\", a much greater output than ITER\\'s goal of producing 500 million watts for 500 seconds by the late 2020s. K-DEMO is expected to have a 6.65m diameter major radius tokamak, and a test blanket module as part of the DEMO breeding blanket R&D. The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology plans to invest about KRW 1 trillion (US$ 941 million) in the project. About KRW 300 billion of that spending has already been funded. The government expects the project to employ nearly 2,400 people in the first phase, which will last throughout 2016. K-DEMO is expected to have an initial operational phase from about 2037 to 2050 to develop components for the second stage, which would produce electricity.### FAST (Fusion by Advanced Superconducting Tokamak)FAST aims to generate and sustain a plasma of deuterium-tritium (D-T) reactions, demonstrating an integrated fusion energy system that combines energy conversion including electricity generation and fuel technologies. To be sited in Japan, the project aims for power generation demonstration by the end of the 2030s. The aim is for power generation of 50 to 100 MW with 1000 seconds of D-T fusion burn, with the device planned to operate for a cumulative 1000 hours of full-power operation.EASTIn China the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) at China Academy of Sciences\\' Hefei Institutes of Physical Science (HFIPS) produced hydrogen plasma at 50 million degrees Celsius and held it for 102 seconds in 2017. In November 2018 it achieved 100 million degrees Celsius for 10 seconds, with input of 10 MW of electric power. In July 2020 EAST achieved a completely non-inductive, current-driven, steady-state plasma for over 100 seconds, claimed as a breakthrough with significant implications for the future China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR). In May 2021 it set a new world record of achieving a plasma temperature of 120 million degrees Celsius for 101 seconds. The experiment also realized a plasma temperature of 160 million degrees Celsius, lasting 20 seconds.TFTRIn the USA, the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) operated at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) from 1982 to 1997. In December 1993, TFTR became the first magnetic fusion device to perform extensive experiments with plasmas composed of D-T. The following year TFTR produced 10.7 MW of controlled fusion power – a record at that time. TFTR set other records, including the achievement of a plasma temperature of 510 million degrees centigrade in 1995. However, it did not achieve its goal of break-even fusion energy (where the energy input required is no greater than the amount of fusion energy produced), but achieved all of its hardware design goals, thus making substantial contributions to the development of ITER.ALCATORAt the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) since the 1970s a succession of small ALCATOR (Alto Campus Torus) high magnetic field torus reactors have operated on the principle of achieving high plasma pressure as the route to long plasma confinement. Alcator C-Mod is claimed to have the highest magnetic field and highest plasma pressure of any fusion reactor, and is the largest university-based fusion reactor in the world. It operated 1993-2016. In September 2016 it achieved a plasma pressure of 2.05 atmospheres at a temperature of 35 million degrees Celsius. The plasma produced 300 trillion fusion reactions per second and had a central magnetic field strength of 5.7 tesla. It carried 1.4 million amps of electrical current and was heated with over 4 MW of power. The reaction occurred in a volume of approximately 1 cubic metre and the plasma lasted for two seconds. Having achieved this record performance for a fusion reactor, government funding ceased.A scaled-up version planned to be built at Triotsk near Moscow in collaboration with the Kurchatov Institute is Ignitor, with 1.3 m diameter torus.### Large Helical Device\\xa0– stellaratorThe Large Helical Device (LHD) at Japan\\'s National Institute for Fusion Science in Toki, in the Gifu Prefecture, was the world\\'s largest stellarator. LHD produced its first plasma in 1998 and has demonstrated plasma confinement properties comparable to other large fusion devices. It has achieved an ion temperature of 13.5 keV (about 160 million degrees) and plasma stored energy of 1.44 million joules (MJ).### Wendelstein 7-X stellaratorFollowing a year of tests, this started up at the end of 2015, and helium plasma briefly reached about one million degrees centigrade.\\xa0In 2016 it progressed to using hydrogen, and using 2 MW it achieved plasma of 80 million degrees centigrade for a quarter of a second. W7-X is the world’s largest stellarator and it is planned to operate continuously for up to 30 minutes. It cost €1 billion ($1.1 billion).\\xa0\\xa0  Some good diagrams are in a\\xa0\\xa0on the Wendelstein 7-X.### Heliac-1 stellaratorAt the\\xa0Australian Plasma Fusion Research Facility\\xa0at the Australian National University the H-1 stellarator has run for some years and in 2014 was upgraded significantly. H-1 is capable of accessing a wide range of plasma configurations and allows exploration of ideas for improved magnetic design of the fusion power stations that will follow ITER.### National\\xa0Ignition\\xa0Facility\\xa0– laserThe world\\'s most powerful laser fusion facility, the $4 billion National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), was completed in March 2009. Using its 192 laser beams, NIF is able to deliver more than 60 times the energy of any previous laser system to its target. LLNL announced in July 2012 that in \"an historic record-breaking laser shot, the NIF laser system of 192 beams delivered more than 500 TW of peak power and 1.85 megajoules (MJ) of ultraviolet laser light to its (2mm diameter) target\" for a few trillionths of a second. In September 2013 for the first time the amount of energy released through the fusion reaction (14 kJ) exceeded the amount of energy being absorbed by the fuel, but not the amount supplied by the giant lasers (1.8 MJ). In August 2021 LLNL said that it had achieved a yield of 1.3 MJ, much better than its previous best of 55 kJ in 2018. It said this was \"a historic step forward for inertial confinment\" putting it \"at the threshold of fusion ignition.\"\\xa0In August 2021 NIF achieved a record fusion yield of 1.3 megajoules – 24 times greater than its previous best experiment – which LLNL said places it \"at the threshold of fusion ignition\".\\xa0A breakthrough in December 2022 resulted in an NIF experiment demonstrating the fundamental scientific basis for inertial confinement fusion energy for the first time. The experiment created fusion ignition when using 192 laser beams to deliver more than 2 MJ of ultraviolet energy to a deuterium-tritium fuel pellet.An earlier high-power laser at LLNL, Nova, was built in 1984 for the purpose of achieving ignition. Nova failed to do this and was closed in 1999, but provided essential data that led to the design of NIF. Nova also generated considerable amounts of data on high-density matter physics, which is useful both in fusion power and nuclear weapons research.In connection with NIF, LLNL is developing the Laser Inertial Fusion Engine (LIFE), a hybrid fusion system where neutrons resulting from laser fusion would drive a subcritical nuclear fission blanket to generate electricity. The blanket would contain either depleted uranium; used nuclear fuel; natural uranium or thorium; or plutonium-239, minor actinides and fission products from reprocessed used nuclear fuel.### Laser MégajouleMeanwhile, the French Atomic Energy Commission (Commissariat à l\\'énergie atomique, CEA) has operated a similar size laser – the Laser Mégajoule (LMJ) – near Bordeaux since 2014. Its 240 laser beams are able to generate 1.8 MJ pulses for a few billionths of a second, concentrated on a small deuterium and tritium target. A prototype laser, the Ligne d\\'Integration Laser (LIL), commenced operation in 2003.### SG-IIChina’s National Laboratory of High-Power Laser and Physics, associated with the China Academy of Science, has a laser inertial confinement experiment in Shanghai – the Shenguang-II eight-beam laser facility (SG-II), similar to the National Ignition Facility in the USA and Laser Mégajoule in France. It is the only high power neodymium-glass solid laser facility with an active probe light in China.\\u202fIn 2005 a ninth beam was added, advancing the capacity for fusion research. The SG-II facility is China’s high-power laser technology international demonstration base.### PETAL and HiPER lasersThe Petawatt Aquitaine Laser (PETAL) laser facility is a high energy multi-petawatt laser (3.5 kJ energy with a duration of 0.5 to 5 ps) under construction near Bordeaux, on the same site as LIL. PETAL will be coupled with LIL to demonstrate the physics and laser technology of fast ignition.The High Power Laser Energy Research Facility (HiPER) is being designed to build on the research planned at the PETAL project. HiPER will use a long pulse laser (currently estimated at 200kJ) combined with a 70kJ short pulse laser. A three-year preparatory phase that commenced in 2008 has direct funding or in-kind commitments amounting to around €70 million from several countries. The detailed engineering phase is projected to begin in 2011, with a six-year construction phase possibly commencing by 2014.### Z machineOperated by Sandia National Laboratories, the Z machine is the largest X-ray generator in the world. As with NIF, the facility was built as part of the country\\'s Stockpile Stewardship Program, which aims to maintain the stockpile of nuclear weapons without the need for full-scale testing.Conditions for fusion are achieved by passing a powerful electrical pulse (lasting less than 100 nanoseconds) through a set of fine tungsten wires inside a metal hohlraum. The wires turn into a plasma and experience a compression (\\'Z-pinch\\'), forcing the vapourized particles to collide with each other, thereby producing intense X-ray radiation. A tiny cylinder containing fusion fuel placed inside the hohlraum would therefore be compressed by the X-rays, allowing fusion to occur.In 2006, Z machine had achieved temperatures of over 2 billion degrees, considerably higher than what is needed for fusion, and in theory high enough to allow nuclear fusion of hydrogen with heavier elements such as lithium or boron.### Other fusion projectsThere is a considerable amount of research into many other fusion projects at various stages of development.**Lockheed CFR**. Lockheed Martin at its so-called ‘skunk works’ is developing a  (CFR) which uses conventional D-T plasma in evacuated containment but confines it differently. Instead of constraining the plasma within tubular rings, a series of superconducting coils will generate a new magnetic-field geometry in which the plasma is held within the broader confines of the entire reaction chamber. The energy is supplied by radiofrequency heating. Superconducting magnets within the coils will generate a magnetic field around the outer border of the chamber. The aim is to go to plasma pressure being as great as confining pressure at high enough temperature for ignition and net energy yield. Heat exchangers in the reactor wall would convey energy to a gas turbine. It has progressed to a magentized ion confinement experiment, but has some way to go before any prototype, which they claim will be very much smaller than conventional designs such as the ITER tokamak.Italy\\'s National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA) is developing a small tokamak reactor by the name of **Ignitor**. Under an Italian-Russian agreement signed in May 2010, a reactor will be assembled in Italy and installed at the Kurchatov Institute\\'s Troitsk Institute for Innovation and Fusion Research (TRINITI) near Moscow.An alternative to using powerful lasers for inertial confinement fusion is \\'**heavy ion fusion**\\', where high-energy particles from an accelerator are focused using magnetic fields onto the fusion target.\\xa0The  (Neutralized Drift Compression Experiment II) accelerator has been used for heavy ion fusion experiments since 2012 at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. It is being expanded to deliver short intense pulses of ion beams with kinetic energy of 1.2 MeV. High-energy-density physics (HEDP) experiments with laboratory plasmas is a growing part of inertial fusion energy (IFE) physics. (Lawrenceville Plasma Physics) is a US enterprise developing aneutronic fusion using a dense plasma focus device (DPF or **focus fusion**) and hydrogen-boron fuel. The hydrogen and boron (B-11) as plasma fuse at high temperature to form a pulsed beam of helium nuclei without emitting neutrons. (The boron and hydrogen combine to produce a brief intermediate carbon-12 atom which rapidly decays to three alpha particles.) This charged high-energy ion beam generates electricity as it passes through a series of coils similar to a transformer, at 80% efficiency. The balance of energy is as by-product X-rays which are captured in an array of photoelectric receptors. LPP Fusion has achieved electron energies of 400 keV.Another line of fusion research using lasers also involves fusing hydrogen and boron-11 to produce helium nuclei, which continue the chain reaction from boron. One laser generates a powerful magnetic confinement field in a coil to trap the fusion reaction in a small area for a nanosecond, while a second more powerful laser triggers the nuclear fusion process. Early H-11B fusion trials at the Prague Asterix Laser System, using high-energy iodine lasers, have generated more energy than needed to trigger the fusion process.\\xa0in Australia develops this and is aiming to use non-thermal laser technology to fuse hydrogen and boron-11. A nanosecond laser pulse ignites a H-B fusion reaction, then a second laser and capacitive coil produce a kilotesla magnetic field to increase the reaction yield. This step is now the focus of research. The yield is increased further by a chain reaction to create helium nuclei which are captured in a charged sphere of at least two metres diameter to produce electricity directly, without any steam circuit. The 2.9 MeV alpha particles represent up to 300 kWh of energy per 15 mg H-11B fuel. A new project is developing fuel materials by synthesizing boron-11-enriched hydrogen borides and hydrogen-adsorbed boron nitride nanosheets. These will be tested at laser facilities overseas.The **Polywell** (\\'polyhedron\\' combined with \\'potential well\\')\\xa0device\\xa0consists of magnetic coils arranged in a polyhedral configuration of six sides, forming a cube. A cloud of electrons is confined in the middle of the device so as to be able to accelerate and confine the positive ions to be fused. This electrostatic confinement concept differs from traditional magnetic confinement because the fields do not need to confine ions\\xa0– only electrons.  has been researching the Polywell concept and looking at hydrogen and boron as fuel for aneutronic fusion. This followed some years of development by the US Navy, using deuterium fuel.**** is one of a number of private efforts to develop a commercial fusion power plant. The company’s magnetized target fusion (MTF) approach generates a compact toroid plasma in an injector, containing and compressing it using a magnetic field before injecting it into a spherical compression chamber. The chamber holds a liquid lead-lithium liner which is pumped to create a vortex, into which the plasma target is injected. A synchronized array of pistons firing simultaneously creates a spherical compression wave in the liquid metal, compressing the plasma target and heating it to fusion conditions. Founded in Canada in 2002, General Fusion is funded by a syndicate of private investors, energy venture capital companies, sovereign wealth funds and the Canadian government’s Sustainable Development Technology Canada (SDTC) fund. A further government grant was announced in October 2018, from the Strategic Innovation Fund. The company has demonstrated milestones including creating 200-300 eV magnetized spheromak plasmas and confining them for over 500 µs.Much of current work underway on MTF is derived from programmes at the Soviet Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy, under E. P. Velikhov, circa 1970. This inspired the LINUS project at the Naval Research Laboratory in the USA, and later the fast-liner project at Los Alamos.General Atomics has operated the  tokamak in San Diego for the US Department of Energy since the late 1980s. It aims to establish the scientific basis for optimizing the tokamak approach to fusion energy production.### Cold fusionIn March 1989, spectacular claims were made for another approach, when two researchers, in the USA (Stanley Pons) and the UK (Martin Fleischmann), claimed to have achieved fusion in a simple tabletop apparatus working at room temperature. \\'N-Fusion\\', or \\'cold fusion\\', involves the electrolysis of heavy water using palladium electrodes on which deuterium nuclei are said to concentrate at very high densities. The researchers claimed that heat – which could only be explained in terms of nuclear processes – was produced, as well as fusion byproducts, including helium, tritium and neutrons. Other experimenters failed to replicate this, however, and most of the scientific community no longer considers it a real phenomenon.### Low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR)Initiated by claims for ‘cold fusion’, research at the nanotechnology level is continuing on low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR) which apparently use weak nuclear interactions (rather than strong force as in nuclear fission or fusion) to create low-energy neutrons, followed by neutron capture processes resulting in isotopic change or transmutation, without the emission of strong prompt radiation. LENR experiments involve hydrogen or deuterium permeation through a catalytic layer and reaction with a metal. Researchers report that energy is released, though on any reproducible basis, very little more than is input. The main practical example is hydrogen plus nickel powder evidently giving more heat than can be explained on any chemical basis.The Japanese government is sponsoring LENR research\\xa0– notably a nano-metal hydrogen energy project (MHE)\\xa0– through its New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), and Mitsubishi is also active in research.\\xa0Over 2015-2019 Google funded 30 researchers on three projects and found no evidence that LENR is possible, but they made some advances in measurement and materials science techniques. There was some indication that the two projects involving palladium merited further study.Assessing fusion power----------------------The use of fusion power plants could substantially reduce the environmental impacts of increasing world electricity demands since, like nuclear fission power, they would not contribute to acid rain or the greenhouse effect. Fusion power could easily satisfy the energy needs associated with continued economic growth, given the ready availability of fuels. There would be no danger of a runaway fusion reaction as this is intrinsically impossible and any malfunction would result in a rapid shutdown of the plant.However, although fusion does not generate long-lived radioactive products and the unburned gases can be treated on site, there would a short- to medium-term radioactive waste problem due to activation of the structural materials. Some component materials will become radioactive during the lifetime of a reactor, due to bombardment with high-energy neutrons, and will eventually become radioactive waste. The volume of such waste would be similar to the corresponding volumes from fission reactors. However, the long-term radiotoxicity of the fusion wastes would be considerably lower than that from actinides in used fission fuel, and the activation product wastes would be handled in much the same way as those from fission reactors with some years of operation..There are also other concerns, principally regarding the possible release of tritium into the environment. It is radioactive and very difficult to contain since it can penetrate concrete, rubber and some grades of steel. As an isotope of hydrogen, it is easily incorporated into water, making the water itself weakly radioactive. With a half-life of about 12.3 years, the presence of tritium remains a threat to health for about 125 years after it is created, as a gas or in water, if at high levels. It can be inhaled, absorbed through the skin or ingested. Inhaled tritium spreads throughout the soft tissues and tritiated water mixes quickly with all the water in the body. Although there is only a small inventory of tritium in a fusion reactor – a few grams – each could conceivably release significant quantities of tritium during operation through routine leaks, assuming the best containment systems. An accident could release even more. This is one reason why long-term hopes are for the deuterium-deuterium fusion process, dispensing with tritium.While fusion power clearly has much to offer when the technology is eventually developed, the problems associated with it also need to be addressed if it is to become a widely used future energy source.* * *Notes & References------------------### Notesa. The nucleus of deuterium (D) consists of one proton and one neutron, whereas hydrogen only has one proton. Tritium (T) has one proton and two neutrons. When the nuclei of D and T fuse, helium-4 (two protons and two neutrons) is formed, along with a free neutron. The 17.6 MeV of energy released in the fusion reaction takes the form of kinetic energy, the helium having 3.5 MeV and the neutron 14.1 MeV. The products of the fusion reaction have a total mass that is slightly lower than the starting materials (D and T), this decrease in mass having been converted to energy according to E=mc2. ]b. Tritium can be produced by bombardment of lithium-6 with neutrons of any energy. When lithium-6 (three protons, three neutrons) absorbs a neutron it splits into helium (two protons, two neutrons) and tritium (one proton, two neutrons), along with the release of 4.8 MeV of energy. Tritium can also be produced from the more-abundant lithium-7 from high-energy neutrons. Hence, natural lithium can be used for tritium generation in a fusion reactor. According to the European Commission: \"A 1 GW (electric) fusion plant will need about 100 kg deuterium and 3 tons of natural lithium to operate for a whole year, generating about 7 billion kWh.\" ]c. The European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA) was established to provide a framework for magnetic confinement fusion research within the European Union and Switzerland. ]d. The Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory has a webpage on TFTR\\xa0]e. The first inertial confinement fusion experiments at NIF (see  will use the \\'indirect drive\\' method, which differs from the \\'direct drive\\' method described in the main text. In the indirect drive method, the lasers are focused on a gold cavity (known as a _hohlraum_) containing the fuel pellet. The lasers rapidly heat the inside surface of the hohlraum, generating X-rays that cause a blowoff of the capsule surface, in turn causing the fuel capsule to implode in the same way as if it had been hit with the lasers directly. It is hoped that NIF will be the first laser in which the energy released from the fusion fuel will exceed the laser energy used to produce the fusion reaction. ]f. Z machine was designed to supply X-ray pulses of 50 terawatts, but improvements allowed pulses of 290 terawatts.

(Image: A. Barber Huescar/IAEA)Newly released nuclear power data for 2023 collected by the IAEA, paint a picture of a clean energy technology at a crossroads amid the  to accelerate its deployment.Electricity production from nuclear power rose by 2.6 per cent last year compared to 2022, according to the operating data provided by IAEA Member States to the Power Reactor Information System (PRIS) — the IAEA’s comprehensive and publicly available database on nuclear power. Nuclear power continued to generate almost 10 percent of the world’s electricity and a quarter of all low carbon electricity last year, according to the data, which are featured in two newly released annual IAEA publications: Nuclear Power Reactors in the World () and Operating Experience with Nuclear Power Stations in Member States ().The USA remained the world’s top producer of nuclear electricity, followed by China and France. China continued to lead in newbuilds, beginning construction on five reactors. Newcomer Egypt started building its second reactor, according to the data, which showed the global fleet operating at nearly full strength with a median capacity factor of 88 per cent. While new grid connections were made at nuclear power plants in Belarus, China, Republic of Korea, Slovakia and the United States of America, reactors were shut down in Belgium, China and Germany.The 2023 data come against the backdrop of growing global ambitions for nuclear technology amid an aging reactor fleet. More than two-thirds of reactors are at least 30 years old. In December 2023, in the historic first Global Stocktake at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai, the 198 signatory countries to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change called for accelerating the deployment of low-emission energy technologies including nuclear power for deep and rapid decarbonization, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as industry. In addition, more than 20 countries at COP28 pledged to work towards tripling global nuclear power capacity to reach net zero by 2050.“IAEA data shows the global fleet of nuclear reactors continues to be a large and indispensable source of low-carbon electricity,” said IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi. “But it’s also clear that we will need to extend the lives of existing reactors, replace retiring facilities with new ones, and add a lot of new capacity so that global climate change and energy security goals can be reached.”]( Nuclear Power Development and Operating Experience Highlights------------------------------------------------------------------**Nuclear power status and trends**]( Taiwan, China - nuclear electricity produced:17.2 TWh, share of nuclear electricity produced: 6.9 per cent. Ukraine has not submitted 2023 data by the time of publication]( of the end of December 2023, global operational nuclear power capacity was 371.5 GW(e), provided by 413 reactors in 31 countries. However, only 403 reactors, with a combined capacity of 364.5 GW(e), reported their electricity production to the IAEA. Twenty-five reactors remained in suspended operations throughout the year, despite being licenced for operation. This includes four reactors in India with a combined net capacity of 639 MW(e) and 21 reactors in Japan with a combined net capacity of around 21 000 MW(e). Japan restarted two reactors in 2023, Takahama-1 and Takahama-2, which had been in suspended operation since 2011.Nuclear power capacity has remained at a consistent level over the past decade, with an additional 69.8 GW(e) nuclear capacity connected to the grid since the beginning of 2013. Over 79 per cent of this capacity growth occurred in Asia. China is still the fastest expanding nuclear power producer of the world, the reports on nuclear power reactors and operating experience show.China currently has 56 nuclear power reactors in operation and a further 27 reactors currently under construction.\\xa0Background----------The annual \\xa0 underscores the IAEA\\'s long-standing commitment as the custodian of the only officially collected and maintained data relating to nuclear power operating experience. As in previous years, the 55th edition of the report includes annual performance data, outage information, and statistical information on electricity production and the overall performance of individual nuclear power plants that were operational in 2023. is one of the IAEA’s most popular annual publications. It contains a summary of recent specification and performance data on nuclear reactors in IAEA Member States and technical data on reactors that are either planned, under construction, operational or that were shut down or decommissioned.\\xa0\\xa0Both publications are entirely based on data submitted to IAEA by officially nominated national data providers and maintained in , the world’s only authoritative and most comprehensive database on nuclear power.Information and data received by the IAEA through 21 June 2024 are included in the 2023 highlights and in the OPEX and RDS-2 publications.

Small modular reactors (SMRs) — a cheaper, quicker-to-deploy alternative to the large nuclear power plants (LNPPs) that have traditionally dominated the sector — potentially offer a form of fossil fuel–free electricity that could help the world reach its emissions targets. However, a wide range of SMR designs exist or are in development — 68 are listed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) — and the lack of a dominant, proven model could curb commitments from utilities and investors.**Most SMR designs are being developed in the US, Russia, and China, but the sector is attracting companies from a large number of countries, even those with limited or no nuclear experience, such as Argentina and Poland. In a major signal of progress, Rolls-Royce was named in June 2025 as the preferred bidder by Great British Energy - Nuclear to build the UK’s first SMRs — a milestone that brings the promise of this technology closer to reality and underscores growing confidence in its commercial viability.An even wider range of nations is thinking about adopting SMR designs developed by other countries, with over 30 considering, planning, or starting new nuclear power programs, amid projections that meeting 2050 net zero targets may require up to 800 GW of new nuclear capacity — more than double what has been built over the last six decades.The designs gaining the most traction — along with the costs, regulatory conditions, and supply chains they will need to gain a solid foothold in the market — are summarized below and explored in full detail in the\\xa0.THE MAIN SMR DESIGNS--------------------SMRs are defined by the IAEA as having power capacity of up to 300 MWe, and broadly fall into two categories:1.  **Gen III/III+** — adaptations of existing LNPP designs that use light water as the coolant; they offer the market familiar, well-understood technology.\\xa0    2.  **Gen IV** — new designs that use different cooling sources, such as helium, molten salt, or molten metal (e.g., sodium and lead); these are untested technologies with limited to no operating experience.\\xa0    !!\\xa0SMR designs by typeThe coolants and fuels used in Gen IV reactors may enable them to operate at much higher temperatures than LNPPs without the need for significantly pressurized containment vessels. This would greatly improve safety — a key issue for nuclear power — and enable new industrial applications beyond low-emission power generation, including the production of green steel and ammonia.PROVING THE POTENTIAL OF SMRs-----------------------------A key advantage of SMRs is their modular, factory-based construction. Components are built using standardized processes, which cuts costs and deployment times compared with often bespoke LNPPs.However, to get SMRs into the market, the firms behind the technology need to prove that it is fit for purpose. While China and Russia have begun to produce power using SMRs, some promising projects elsewhere have faced setbacks. NuScale’s Idaho Falls project was cancelled in November 2023 due to growing concerns over cost overruns, construction delays, and a declining willingness among project stakeholders to bear the risks associated with FOAK development. This is because China and Russia have comparatively fewer regulatory hurdles, and Western utilities want to know that SMRs can work in jurisdictions with regulations and operating environments similar to their own before they commit.\\xa0We believe that only a handful of the currently active SMR designs will reach successful commercial deployment, but high uncertainty exists around which will prevail.

The Danish government’s work with the wind power sector provides a successful path — plans, tariffs, and R&D funding initiatives it put in place during the 1990s encouraged development of the industry, and wind power now produces 54% of Danish electricity, while the country boasts numerous world leaders in the sector.!!\\xa0Lessons for SMRs from comparable industriesThe costs SMRs will have to achieve to compete with other forms of baseload power will vary by country, with analysis showing the average cost of producing electricity over their lifetime needs to be between €52 €/MWh in Sweden and €119 €/MWh in Greece.For this to be attainable, SMRs and their components must be compatible with large-scale production to reach economies of scale. In terms of supply chains, SMR designs based on light water technology and that operate in a similar way to conventional reactors may have an advantage over Gen IV designs, as an extensive LNPP international supply chain already exists.However, while LNPPs are normally tailored to specific customer needs and local regulations, SMRs will rely on common, standardized components manufactured centrally and shipped to the construction site.

The outlook for the industry is being transformed by climate change policies, shifting energy priorities and technological advances. But delivery of a new generation of nuclear facilities could be compromised unless lessons are learned from past projects and the nuclear sector’s endemic cost and schedule overruns.The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts 2025 will mark an all-time high for nuclear power generation as output increases in France, Japanese plants start up again after the pause following the 2011 Fukushima disaster, and commercial reactors begin operations in many markets, including Europe, China, India, and Korea.[1] the US too new output is coming online. The first new-builds in 30 years – Vogtle 3 and 4 in Georgia – have entered commercial service. The Palisades plant in Michigan is scheduled to come back online this year after a $2 billion upgrade following its closure in 2022.[2] US and other governments are supporting this nuclear comeback to meet increased electricity demand and climate goals. Although the new Trump administration has already made moves to drop other low-carbon policy initiatives and funding, nuclear plant licences have been extended, and nuclear projects usually command bipartisan support.[3] (and in some American states), climate policies will drive nuclear expansion. Nuclear energy must make a growing contribution – alongside renewables – if the world is to decarbonize electricity generation. In December 2023, more than 20 countries from four continents at the COP28 climate action summit in Dubai signed a declaration to triple nuclear capacity to achieve global net zero by 2050.[4] European Union has given nuclear power the ‘green’ light for funding to promote sustainability.[5] transition to clean energy is also enabling China – which plans to double its nuclear capacity by 2030 – to reduce air pollution from coal-powered plants in major cities. Other Asian countries face similar challenges.As coal is phased out, wind and solar power have become a bigger source of energy, but renewable energy is intermittent in the absence of large-scale battery storage. Nuclear can provide a reliable baseload supply. Having nuclear in the mix can also protect a nation’s energy security. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine highlighted Europe’s dependence on imported fossil fuels.Meanwhile, the electrification of transport and other industries, and the expansion of data centres running power-hungry AI is stoking demand. In 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that electricity consumption by data centres, AI and the cryptocurrency sector could double by 2026. Electrification needs to accelerate rapidly on the IEA’s pathway for net zero by 2050. Electricity’s share in final energy consumption, which was up from 18% in 2015 to 20% in 2023, would approach 30% in 2030.[6] Tech as well as some other industrial users and governments are willing to pay a premium for secure, low-carbon power. In the US, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have struck high-value purchase agreements with nuclear generators. The energy will be supplied by a mixture of currently operating and recommissioned plants and a new generation of small modular reactors (SMRs).[7] 20-year contract (with Constellation, America’s largest nuclear operator) will help restart a mothballed reactor at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania. The facility is expected to produce 835 megawatts of power to offset Microsoft’s data centre electricity needs.[8] and Google are also investing in start-ups developing SMRs,[9]\\xa0… Continue reading while Meta has released requests for proposals from providers of 1-4 gigawatts of nuclear generation capacity to power data centres needed for AI.### **SMRs – small, modular and repeatable?**With outputs up to 300 megawatts, SMRs promise a more flexible and affordable nuclear option for supplanting fossil fuel power stations. Conventional larger-scale nuclear reactors can be challenged by their upfront capital costs and construction timelines. Some are projecting that building SMRs could take less than half the construction time for large reactors.[10] Manufacturing modules in controlled factory settings may increase efficiency and assure quality. Modular designs also allow capacity to be increased incrementally, further reducing financing risk.Apart from American SMR-powered nuclear submarines, the first SMR units are already operating in China and Russia. As with solar and wind technology, China gained an advantage on the West in SMR nuclear technology, while Russia leads in SMR fuel production. The US government and companies have been investing in SMR technology to catch up.[11] countries – including Canada and the UK – are also backing SMR technology and its export potential.[12] Some years away from commercial scale, there are said to be more than 80 SMR designs using diverse technologies at different stages of development globally.[13] Demonstration projects later this decade could pave the way for a rollout of commercial SMR fleets beginning in the 2030s.[14] of SMRs believe that their smaller scale and simpler designs should allow standardization and cost-effective manufacturing and assembly. This product-based approach – modelled on ‘shipyard’ production – could improve cost and schedule performance.[15]### The case for caution in nuclear constructionOur global experience of major nuclear engineering and construction projects – and other sectors (including shipbuilding) – teaches caution.Early SMRs will be first-of-a-kind projects with the associated risks and uncertainties that entails. In 2023 the first planned SMR in the US was cancelled due to rising construction costs and an electricity price uncompetitive with wind and solar.[16] Costs and delays could arise as the industry adapts to new designs and processes. This may also apply to the new generation of ‘advanced nuclear reactors’ using futuristic technologies (that some SMRs may leverage), such as molten salt, high-temperature gas cooling and sodium cooling, and travelling wave designs.[17] shorter SMR construction schedules do not guarantee programme certainty. Building a downsized reactor is still a complex capital project. Units should be easier to deploy – on brownfield sites of retired coal-fired plants, for example, or off-grid to provide power or heat to industry. Every location has unique features that can challenge contractors, however., which analyses the incidence and causes of claims and disputes, confirms the comparatively poor record of nuclear projects. Over the seven-year timeframe to 2024, disputed costs averaged 62.8% of budgeted capital expenditure on 27 nuclear projects in seven countries. This was notably higher than for power stations fuelled by fossil fuels (74 projects in total, in 32 countries), which faced overruns of 40.7%.![]( extensions of time claimed by contractors were highest on European nuclear projects – averaging 74% of planned schedules, and three times longer than in the Middle East (the region with the longest overruns for all infrastructure and capital projects).[18]CRUX data for time extensions on US nuclear projects is not cited here as it includes claims for the additional costs of storing spent nuclear due to breach of contract over the federal\\xa0… Continue readingResultant distress may be higher, but most of the main causes of claims and disputes on nuclear projects are shared with other types of construction projects. Change in scope, the primary and near-universal driver of conflict in construction, was nearly twice as likely to affect nuclear projects (34.5%) as fossil power stations.Another, related cause was late design information (24.1%). Immature designs not only make conflicts and delays during construction more likely, they also make it difficult to verify cost estimates and schedules. Optimism bias is by no means unique to the nuclear sector, but unrealistic budgets and schedules and the significant overruns that result can derail projects.[19]National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2023. Laying the Foundation for New and Advanced Nuclear Reactors in the United States.  ### Learning the lessons of past failuresCosts have ballooned on EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) contracts for nuclear plant projects around the world. This has often arisen from the civil (non-nuclear) construction element, according to a 2023 US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report on new nuclear construction.[20]National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2023. Laying the Foundation for New and Advanced Nuclear Reactors in the United States. Global in scope, the report also noted that past studies had cited ‘negative learning for nuclear.’It is no surprise that most recurrent causes of conflict across the CRUX database of 2,000 projects are also prominent in the nuclear sector. Poor management of subcontractors and their interfaces affected almost one in four nuclear projects (24.1%); and clashes over contract interpretation even more (27.6%).Alleged bias or failure to cooperate was far more common in nuclear (17.2%) than fossil power (2.9%) projects, perhaps reflecting a greater cultural diversity of project partners, if not sheer complexity.Part of that complexity arises from the regulatory requirements around nuclear safety. CRUX indicates that nuclear projects were more likely to be affected by late approvals than fossil fuel power stations (20.7% vs. 8.8%) or all non-nuclear power projects(16.5%). Such delays may be due to the procedures of either/both employers and regulators. Inadequate responses to information requests were also notably more common in the nuclear sector than in the power sector as a whole (20.7% vs. 8.1%). However, poor interface management with third parties was blamed for disputes on a slightly smaller proportion of nuclear than non-nuclear power projects (10.3% vs. 13.2%).Some argue skills shortages are to be expected in an industry that has been stagnant for many years. The IEA identified investment in human capital as a priority for countries committing to nuclear growth. Utilities have generally not retained the staff needed to execute large nuclear projects. Many megaproject owners rely on outsourced technical expertise, and lack the capacity to oversee projects (which is not unique to the nuclear industry).[21]National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2023. Laying the Foundation for New and Advanced Nuclear Reactors in the United States. Much of the global construction industry suffers from skills gaps and problems with workmanship. The US, for example, has a shortfall in mechanical and electrical engineering talent, as well as critical trades such as welding.![]( More proactive reactor constructionAs much as $1.5 trillion could be invested in the nuclear renaissance through to 2050,[22] but the scale and unpredictability of construction costs remain a major obstacle. Citing past cost and schedule overruns, an investment analysis of the European nuclear market calls for new frameworks to mitigate the construction risks and attract capital.[23] CRUX research and some of the other evidence explored here point to some essential guardrails for new-build nuclear projects.At the outset, challenge sessions and war gaming can help crystallize the risks and choices for investors, promoters and other stakeholders. Independent checks of cost estimates and schedules by industry experts can mitigate optimism bias. The earlier the design is completed on a project, the fewer associated delays are likely to be encountered, and the greater chance the project will be delivered on time and budget.A proactive approach by project employers and fairly balanced allocation of risks among the parties will improve risk management and foster more productive working relationships with EPC contractors. Intelligent use of BIM (building information modelling) can enhance coordination and construction management. The potential benefits over the life cycle of both the project and operations may justify the creation of digital twins. During construction, comprehensive risk registers and robust project controls remain essential to keep projects on track.Notwithstanding new funding models, most nuclear projects worldwide rely on some level of government support – not only financial, but also to address skills shortages and regulatory risk. In the US, for example, the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act recognised the need to fund the training of a new generation of nuclear engineers and fill gaps in other project-critical professions and trades.Meanwhile, project teams can tailor design processes to align with regulation so that approvals overlap with design progress to minimise hold-ups. The ability to replicate proven SMRs should ease this regulatory burden. International efforts to streamline and harmonise design certification are also encouraging.[24] the project level, a proactive approach to engineering and construction will be needed to mitigate risk and avoid past pitfalls, enabling cost-effective delivery of the nuclear renaissance.### About the authorKim Reome is a specialist in damages analysis in the construction and electric utility industries with over 30 years’ experience.

(Photo: D. Calma/IAEA)There is growing global interest in nuclear energy, and countries are acting on this interest. In the opening session of the Scientific Forum, the President of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo, shared his plans for the inclusion of nuclear energy in the country’s electricity generation mix. “We’re committed to a clean, equitable energy transition that harnesses the full potential of all low carbon sources, including nuclear power,” President Akufo-Addo said. “Nuclear power will play a significant part in this transformation.”\\xa0\\xa0Ghana is analysing small modular reactors (SMRs) and their potential for rapid deployment for clean and affordable energy. “We are working with industry experts to study the feasibility of deploying this new technology in Ghana,” President Akufo-Addo said.\\xa0In the United States of America, where nuclear power provides the single largest source of clean energy, “reaching our 2050 net zero goals depends on at least tripling our nuclear energy capacity to 300 gigawatts or more,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm. The US Government has invested “billions of dollars in the future of nuclear energy, creating historic tax incentives for investments in new facilities and production of nuclear energy,” and the development of a domestic fuel supply chain is underway, she added\\xa0\\xa0The US Department of Energy recently released , a set of reports to accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies, including advanced nuclear reactors. Advanced reactors are key to reaching net zero goals because they can help to decarbonize energy intensive industries, such as hydrogen production, desalination, district heating, petroleum refining and fertilizer production, Secretary Granholm said. She encouraged more countries to look at nuclear energy as a sustainable, long term investment and to harness “the power of the atom for a new era of peace and prosperity in what is potentially the greatest peace project of our time – a net zero world.”\\xa0The Republic of Korea is also investing in growing its nuclear sector. Since 2000, Korea has been implementing its Nuclear Power System Development Plan, with a specific focus on developing advanced reactors, and as a result, in 2012, Korea’s first SMR – SMART – received the standard design approval from the Korean regulator, said Lee Jong-Ho, Minister of Science and ICT in the Republic of Korea. “Now we are developing an even more advanced and innovative SMR based on SMART technology,” he added.\\xa0\\xa0The Korean Government believes that the private sector should take the lead in technological innovations. “This is especially true for the SMR sector, which aims to replace fossil fuels in industries such as seawater desalination and space exploration,” Minister Jong-Ho said. The Korean Government is launching the Korea SMR Initiative to transfer SMART and other advanced nuclear technologies to the private sector in order to help demonstrate and commercialize new reactors. “To kick start these efforts, starting next year, the Government will collaborate with the relevant companies to invest in developing high temperature gas reactors designed for industrial process heat with applications such as hydrogen production and other uses,” he said.\\xa0In Morocco, the Government is considering adding nuclear power to its energy mix to ensure a reliable energy supply. “Morocco places a distinct focus on small modular reactors due to their numerous advantages, including the flexibility for integration,” said Leila Benali, Morocco’s Minister of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development, in a video statement to the Forum. “They hold significant promise for diverse applications, such as combined heat and power generation and seawater desalination.”\\xa0Minister Benali also announced that Morocco’s National Centre for Nuclear Energy, Sciences and Technology has been designated as an , enabling it to function as a global learning platform. “Morocco\\'s national infrastructure that is now reinforced by this recognition is open for the benefit of the African continent with a focus on capacity building,” she said.\\xa0\\xa0For the past 40 years, Sweden has expanded different forms of renewable energy, with wind power providing a significant share of electricity, and biomass replacing oil and coal for district heating and industrial processes. “What was forgotten, though, was that the power system is very sensitive and that it has to work technically. It\\'s not just about adding terawatt hours,” said Sweden’s Vice Minister for Climate and the Environment, Daniel Westlén. Considering the requirement for dispatchable energy to meet demand, when and where needed, as well as for demand to be met without carbon emissions, the options are limited. “Nuclear energy is the only option available,” he added.\\xa0\\xa0To reach climate and net zero goals, studies have estimated a doubling or tripling of nuclear energy capacity by 2050. “Can the world build 20 or even 40 gigawatts of nuclear energy per year? I would claim it is possible. We’ve done it before,” Vice Minister Westlén said. In the 1980s, more than 180 reactors were under construction globally, and more than 30 gigawatts were added in one single year, he explained. Sweden deployed 12 large reactors between 1972 and 1985. While “climate change is the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced… we are in possession of the tools that we will need to solve this,” he concluded.\\xa0Last year, French President Emmanuel Macron announced a programme to build six nuclear reactors, as well as a programme dedicated to nuclear and innovation with small and advanced modular reactors. “We need energy, which is at the same time cheap, affordable and sustainable. And that\\'s not so easy to solve,” said François Jacq, General Administrator of the French Atomic Energy Commission. “That\\'s why we need innovation.” Innovation will come in many forms – in applications, approaches and technologies – and will also attract the future generation to the nuclear field.\\xa0“We will also have to innovate in the field of cooperation, in partnership. We have to invent new forms of cooperation. We have to invent new forms of research and technology organization,” General Administrator Jacq said.\\xa0\\xa0![]( energy influencer, Isabelle Boemeke, provided the keynote address at the opening session of the\\xa0Scientific Forum, Nuclear Innovations for Net Zero, at the IAEA 67th General Conference in Vienna, Austria, 26 September 2023. (Photo: D. Calma/IAEA)Wrapping up the opening session, Brazilian-born nuclear energy influencer Isabelle Boemeke, reflected on the power of social media to inform young audiences. “Social media can sound superficial, but the reality is that\\'s how young people learn about the world,” said Boemeke, also known as . “They trust influencers’ opinions on products, health tips and ideas. And while we\\'ve seen social media being used for bad, I believe we can leverage these tools and actually use it for good.”\\xa0She brought attention to the value of leaders in listening and engaging with young generations. “Young people are very much open to it, and they\\'re waiting to hear from people, like yourselves, that it\\'s OK to support this technology. Getting the population informed on all the benefits grants license to our leaders to pursue realistic decarbonization paths\\xa0– paths that very boldly include nuclear power at the heart,” Boemke said. Encouraging the audience of decision makers to be courageous, she concluded by asking, “Are you leaders or followers?”\\xa0Read  in the latest \\xa0![]( Scientific Forum featured a panel of young professionals in the nuclear field. They discussed their motivation to pursue a career in nuclear and the importance of diversity and inclusion. (Photo: H. Shaffer/IAEA)The Forum included a segment on youth, featuring a panel of young professionals in the nuclear field: Benjamin Bertaux, Junior Decommissioning Expert at the IAEA; Loretta Boahemaa Manu, Associate Transport Safety Officer at the IAEA; Yvonne Lin, Nuclear Engineering Intern at the IAEA; and Grace Stanke, nuclear energy advocate and current-Miss America. They expressed how \"cool\" and attractive the nuclear field is for new generations and the importance of creating collaborative research projects with universities to expose students to various career paths. Insisting on the importance of promoting diversity and inclusion in the nuclear industry, the panel shared that to attract new talent, it is as much about the science as it is about storytelling and innovative ways to communicate about nuclear.\\xa0\\xa0Boahemaa Manu and Lin are both fellows of the , which is open for applicants until 30 September.\\xa0The way forward---------------From China to the United Kingdom and beyond, countries around the world have ambitious plans to expand their nuclear fleets. By 2035, China expects to build 150 new nuclear reactors. “We have so many coal-fired power stations that must be replaced by nuclear power,” said Yu Jianfeng,\\u202fChairman of China National Nuclear Corporation, during the closing session of the Forum on Wednesday.\\xa0\\xa0In the United Kingdom, “we have an ambitious target of 24 gigawatts of nuclear power to be on the UK grid by 2050,” said Andrew Bowie, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and Minister for Nuclear and Networks. “As vital as it is to decarbonize our energy baseload, it is also about prices – the cost of living, affordable energy, and being energy secure and independent.”\\xa0\\xa0When it comes to prices, Finland’s Minister of Climate and Environment, Kai Mykkänen, told the Forum that Finland’s Olkiluoto 3, Europe’s largest nuclear reactor at 1.6 gigawatts, has led to the lowest electricity prices in Finland in years. Olkiluoto 3, which began regular output in April, is the key reason Finland has ceased direct electricity and natural gas imports, while simultaneously lowering electricity prices, he said.\\xa0Public acceptance, as well as financing, surrounding nuclear power must also be considered in the path forward. “We have to interact with society to ensure the technical solutions we propose will be, in the end, accepted,” said Peter Baeten, Director General of the Belgian Nuclear Research Center SCK CEN. Furthermore, while technical innovation is essential, there are other aspects of innovation, said Sama Bilbao,\\u202fDirector General of World Nuclear Association. “We need innovation in the way we finance new nuclear. We need to think outside the box to attract investment into these nuclear projects,” she added.\\xa0Given the speed and scale of innovation within the nuclear field, Director General Grossi is optimistic. “There are challenges, but it is clear – we are moving decisively. We are moving, perhaps, at different paces and in different ways,” he said. “The end result will not be uniform because there is not a one-size-fits-all solution. But we can see how nuclear is very firmly positioned in this global effort that is taking place now.”\\xa0\\xa0![]( closing session of the Scientific Forum at the IAEA 67th General Conference held at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, Austria, 27 September 2023.

(Photo: D. Calma/IAEA)There is growing global interest in nuclear energy, and countries are acting on this interest. In the opening session of the Scientific Forum, the President of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo, shared his plans for the inclusion of nuclear energy in the country’s electricity generation mix. “We’re committed to a clean, equitable energy transition that harnesses the full potential of all low carbon sources, including nuclear power,” President Akufo-Addo said. “Nuclear power will play a significant part in this transformation.”\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Ghana is analysing small modular reactors (SMRs) and their potential for rapid deployment for clean and affordable energy. “We are working with industry experts to study the feasibility of deploying this new technology in Ghana,” President Akufo-Addo said.\\\\xa0In the United States of America, where nuclear power provides the single largest source of clean energy, “reaching our 2050 net zero goals depends on at least tripling our nuclear energy capacity to 300 gigawatts or more,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm. The US Government has invested “billions of dollars in the future of nuclear energy, creating historic tax incentives for investments in new facilities and production of nuclear energy,” and the development of a domestic fuel supply chain is underway, she added\\\\xa0\\\\xa0The US Department of Energy recently released , a set of reports to accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies, including advanced nuclear reactors. Advanced reactors are key to reaching net zero goals because they can help to decarbonize energy intensive industries, such as hydrogen production, desalination, district heating, petroleum refining and fertilizer production, Secretary Granholm said. She encouraged more countries to look at nuclear energy as a sustainable, long term investment and to harness “the power of the atom for a new era of peace and prosperity in what is potentially the greatest peace project of our time – a net zero world.”\\\\xa0The Republic of Korea is also investing in growing its nuclear sector. Since 2000, Korea has been implementing its Nuclear Power System Development Plan, with a specific focus on developing advanced reactors, and as a result, in 2012, Korea’s first SMR – SMART – received the standard design approval from the Korean regulator, said Lee Jong-Ho, Minister of Science and ICT in the Republic of Korea. “Now we are developing an even more advanced and innovative SMR based on SMART technology,” he added.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0The Korean Government believes that the private sector should take the lead in technological innovations. “This is especially true for the SMR sector, which aims to replace fossil fuels in industries such as seawater desalination and space exploration,” Minister Jong-Ho said. The Korean Government is launching the Korea SMR Initiative to transfer SMART and other advanced nuclear technologies to the private sector in order to help demonstrate and commercialize new reactors. “To kick start these efforts, starting next year, the Government will collaborate with the relevant companies to invest in developing high temperature gas reactors designed for industrial process heat with applications such as hydrogen production and other uses,” he said.\\\\xa0In Morocco, the Government is considering adding nuclear power to its energy mix to ensure a reliable energy supply. “Morocco places a distinct focus on small modular reactors due to their numerous advantages, including the flexibility for integration,” said Leila Benali, Morocco’s Minister of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development, in a video statement to the Forum. “They hold significant promise for diverse applications, such as combined heat and power generation and seawater desalination.”\\\\xa0Minister Benali also announced that Morocco’s National Centre for Nuclear Energy, Sciences and Technology has been designated as an , enabling it to function as a global learning platform. “Morocco\\\\\\'s national infrastructure that is now reinforced by this recognition is open for the benefit of the African continent with a focus on capacity building,” she said.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0For the past 40 years, Sweden has expanded different forms of renewable energy, with wind power providing a significant share of electricity, and biomass replacing oil and coal for district heating and industrial processes. “What was forgotten, though, was that the power system is very sensitive and that it has to work technically. It\\\\\\'s not just about adding terawatt hours,” said Sweden’s Vice Minister for Climate and the Environment, Daniel Westlén. Considering the requirement for dispatchable energy to meet demand, when and where needed, as well as for demand to be met without carbon emissions, the options are limited. “Nuclear energy is the only option available,” he added.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0To reach climate and net zero goals, studies have estimated a doubling or tripling of nuclear energy capacity by 2050. “Can the world build 20 or even 40 gigawatts of nuclear energy per year? I would claim it is possible. We’ve done it before,” Vice Minister Westlén said. In the 1980s, more than 180 reactors were under construction globally, and more than 30 gigawatts were added in one single year, he explained. Sweden deployed 12 large reactors between 1972 and 1985. While “climate change is the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced… we are in possession of the tools that we will need to solve this,” he concluded.\\\\xa0Last year, French President Emmanuel Macron announced a programme to build six nuclear reactors, as well as a programme dedicated to nuclear and innovation with small and advanced modular reactors. “We need energy, which is at the same time cheap, affordable and sustainable. And that\\\\\\'s not so easy to solve,” said François Jacq, General Administrator of the French Atomic Energy Commission. “That\\\\\\'s why we need innovation.” Innovation will come in many forms – in applications, approaches and technologies – and will also attract the future generation to the nuclear field.\\\\xa0“We will also have to innovate in the field of cooperation, in partnership. We have to invent new forms of cooperation. We have to invent new forms of research and technology organization,” General Administrator Jacq said.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0![]( energy influencer, Isabelle Boemeke, provided the keynote address at the opening session of the\\\\xa0Scientific Forum, Nuclear Innovations for Net Zero, at the IAEA 67th General Conference in Vienna, Austria, 26 September 2023. (Photo: D. Calma/IAEA)Wrapping up the opening session, Brazilian-born nuclear energy influencer Isabelle Boemeke, reflected on the power of social media to inform young audiences. “Social media can sound superficial, but the reality is that\\\\\\'s how young people learn about the world,” said Boemeke, also known as . “They trust influencers’ opinions on products, health tips and ideas. And while we\\\\\\'ve seen social media being used for bad, I believe we can leverage these tools and actually use it for good.”\\\\xa0She brought attention to the value of leaders in listening and engaging with young generations. “Young people are very much open to it, and they\\\\\\'re waiting to hear from people, like yourselves, that it\\\\\\'s OK to support this technology. Getting the population informed on all the benefits grants license to our leaders to pursue realistic decarbonization paths\\\\xa0– paths that very boldly include nuclear power at the heart,” Boemke said. Encouraging the audience of decision makers to be courageous, she concluded by asking, “Are you leaders or followers?”\\\\xa0Read  in the latest \\\\xa0![]( Scientific Forum featured a panel of young professionals in the nuclear field. They discussed their motivation to pursue a career in nuclear and the importance of diversity and inclusion. (Photo: H. Shaffer/IAEA)The Forum included a segment on youth, featuring a panel of young professionals in the nuclear field: Benjamin Bertaux, Junior Decommissioning Expert at the IAEA; Loretta Boahemaa Manu, Associate Transport Safety Officer at the IAEA; Yvonne Lin, Nuclear Engineering Intern at the IAEA; and Grace Stanke, nuclear energy advocate and current-Miss America. They expressed how \"cool\" and attractive the nuclear field is for new generations and the importance of creating collaborative research projects with universities to expose students to various career paths. Insisting on the importance of promoting diversity and inclusion in the nuclear industry, the panel shared that to attract new talent, it is as much about the science as it is about storytelling and innovative ways to communicate about nuclear.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Boahemaa Manu and Lin are both fellows of the , which is open for applicants until 30 September.\\\\xa0The way forward---------------From China to the United Kingdom and beyond, countries around the world have ambitious plans to expand their nuclear fleets. By 2035, China expects to build 150 new nuclear reactors. “We have so many coal-fired power stations that must be replaced by nuclear power,” said Yu Jianfeng,\\\\u202fChairman of China National Nuclear Corporation, during the closing session of the Forum on Wednesday.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0In the United Kingdom, “we have an ambitious target of 24 gigawatts of nuclear power to be on the UK grid by 2050,” said Andrew Bowie, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and Minister for Nuclear and Networks. “As vital as it is to decarbonize our energy baseload, it is also about prices – the cost of living, affordable energy, and being energy secure and independent.”\\\\xa0\\\\xa0When it comes to prices, Finland’s Minister of Climate and Environment, Kai Mykkänen, told the Forum that Finland’s Olkiluoto 3, Europe’s largest nuclear reactor at 1.6 gigawatts, has led to the lowest electricity prices in Finland in years. Olkiluoto 3, which began regular output in April, is the key reason Finland has ceased direct electricity and natural gas imports, while simultaneously lowering electricity prices, he said.\\\\xa0Public acceptance, as well as financing, surrounding nuclear power must also be considered in the path forward. “We have to interact with society to ensure the technical solutions we propose will be, in the end, accepted,” said Peter Baeten, Director General of the Belgian Nuclear Research Center SCK CEN. Furthermore, while technical innovation is essential, there are other aspects of innovation, said Sama Bilbao,\\\\u202fDirector General of World Nuclear Association. “We need innovation in the way we finance new nuclear. We need to think outside the box to attract investment into these nuclear projects,” she added.\\\\xa0Given the speed and scale of innovation within the nuclear field, Director General Grossi is optimistic. “There are challenges, but it is clear – we are moving decisively. We are moving, perhaps, at different paces and in different ways,” he said. “The end result will not be uniform because there is not a one-size-fits-all solution. But we can see how nuclear is very firmly positioned in this global effort that is taking place now.”\\\\xa0\\\\xa0![]( closing session of the Scientific Forum at the IAEA 67th General Conference held at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, Austria, 27 September 2023.

Initially, fusion research in the USA and USSR was linked to atomic weapons development, and it remained classified until the 1958 Atoms for Peace conference in Geneva. Following a breakthrough at the Soviet tokamak, fusion research became \\\\\\'big science\\\\\\' in the 1970s. But the cost and complexity of the devices involved increased to the point where international co-operation was the only way forward.\\\\xa0The Fusion Industry Association report \")\\\\xa0said that $2.83 billion of new investment was declared by private nuclear fusion companies since the 2021 edition of the report.Fusion powers the Sun and stars as hydrogen atoms fuse together to form helium, and matter is converted into energy. Hydrogen, heated to very high temperatures changes from a gas to a plasma in which the negatively-charged electrons are separated from the positively-charged atomic nuclei (ions). Normally, fusion is not possible because the strongly repulsive electrostatic forces between the positively charged nuclei prevent them from getting close enough together to collide and for fusion to occur. However, if the conditions are such that the nuclei can overcome the electrostatic forces to the extent that they can come within a very close range of each other, then the attractive nuclear force (which binds protons and neutrons together in atomic nuclei) between the nuclei will outweigh the repulsive (electrostatic) force, allowing the nuclei to fuse together. Such conditions can occur when the temperature increases, causing the ions to move faster and eventually reach speeds high enough to bring the ions close enough together. The nuclei can then fuse, causing a release of energy.Fusion technology-----------------In the Sun, massive gravitational forces create the right conditions for fusion, but on Earth they are much harder to achieve. Fusion fuel – different isotopes of hydrogen – must be heated to extreme temperatures of the order of 50 million degrees Celsius, and must be kept stable under intense pressure, hence dense enough and confined for long enough to allow the nuclei to fuse. The aim of the controlled fusion research program is to achieve \\\\\\'ignition\\\\\\', which occurs when enough fusion reactions take place for the process to become self-sustaining, with fresh fuel then being added to continue it.\\\\xa0Once ignition is achieved, there is net energy yield – about four times as much as with nuclear fission. According to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the amount of power produced increases with the square of the pressure, so doubling the pressure leads to a fourfold increase in energy production.With current technology, the reaction most readily feasible is between the nuclei of the two heavy forms (isotopes) of hydrogen – deuterium (D) and tritium (T). Each D-T fusion event releases 17.6 MeV (2.8 x 10-12 joule, compared with 200 MeV for a U-235 fission and 3-4 MeV for D-D fusion). On a mass basis, the D-T fusion reaction releases over four times as much energy as uranium fission. Deuterium occurs naturally in seawater (30 grams per cubic metre), which makes it very abundant relative to other energy resources. Tritium occurs naturally only in trace quantities (produced by cosmic rays) and is radioactive, with a half-life of around 12 years. Usable quantities can be made in a conventional nuclear reactor, or in the present context, bred in a fusion system from lithium. Lithium is found in large quantities (30 parts per million) in the Earth\\\\\\'s crust and in weaker concentrations in the sea.In a fusion reactor, the concept is that neutrons generated from the D-T fusion reaction will be absorbed in a blanket containing lithium which surrounds the core. The lithium is then transformed into tritium (which is used to fuel the reactor) and helium. The blanket must be thick enough (about 1 metre) to slow down the\\\\xa0high-energy (14 MeV) neutrons. The kinetic energy of the neutrons is absorbed by the blanket, causing it to heat up. The heat energy is collected by the coolant (water, helium or Li-Pb eutectic) flowing through the blanket and, in a fusion power plant, this energy will be used to generate electricity by conventional methods.\\\\xa0If insufficient tritium is produced, some supplementary source must be employed such as using a fission reactor to irradiate heavy water or lithium with neutrons, and extraneous tritium creates difficulties with handling, storage and transport.The difficulty has been to develop a device that can heat the D-T fuel to a high enough temperature and confine it long enough so that more energy is released through fusion reactions than is used to get the reaction going. While the D-T reaction is the main focus of attention, long-term hopes are for a D-D reaction, but this requires much higher temperatures.In any case, the challenge is to apply the heat to human needs, primarily generating electricity. The energy density of fusion reactions in gas is very much less than for fission reactions in solid fuel, and as noted the heat yield per reaction is 70 times less. Hence thermonuclear fusion will always have a much lower power density than nuclear fission, which means that any fusion reactor needs to be larger and therefore more costly, than a fission reactor of the same power output. In addition, nuclear fission reactors use solid fuel which is denser than a thermonuclear plasma, so the energy released is more concentrated.\\\\xa0Also the neutron energy from fusion is higher than from fission – 14.1 MeV instead of about 2 MeV, which presents significant challenges regarding structural materials.At present, two main experimental approaches are being studied: magnetic confinement and inertial confinement. The first method uses strong magnetic fields to contain the hot plasma. The second involves compressing a small pellet containing fusion fuel to extremely high densities using strong lasers or particle beams.\\\\xa0A range of magnetized target fusion systems are also being developed, along with experiments with hybrid fusion.### Magnetic confinementIn magnetic confinement fusion (MCF), hundreds of cubic metres of D-T plasma at a density of less than a milligram per cubic metre are confined by a magnetic field at a few atmospheres pressure and heated to fusion temperature.Magnetic fields are ideal for confining a plasma because the electrical charges on the separated ions and electrons mean that they follow the magnetic field lines. The aim is to prevent the particles from coming into contact with the reactor walls as this will dissipate their heat and slow them down. The most effective magnetic configuration is toroidal, shaped like a doughnut, in which the magnetic field is curved around to form a closed loop. For proper confinement, this toroidal field must have superimposed upon it a perpendicular field component (a poloidal field). The result is a magnetic field with force lines following spiral (helical) paths that confine and control the plasma.There are several types of toroidal confinement system, the most important being tokamaks, stellarators and reversed field pinch (RFP) devices.In a tokamak, the toroidal field is created by a series of coils evenly spaced around the torus-shaped reactor, and the poloidal field is created by a system of horizontal coils outside the toroidal magnet structure. A strong electric current is induced in the plasma using a central solenoid, and this induced current also contributes to the poloidal field. In a stellarator, the helical lines of force are produced by a series of coils which may themselves be helical in shape. Unlike tokamaks, stellarators do not require a toroidal current to be induced in the plasma. RFP devices have the same toroidal and poloidal components as a tokamak, but the current flowing through the plasma is much stronger and the direction of the toroidal field within the plasma is reversed.In tokamaks and RFP devices, the current flowing through the plasma also serves to heat it to a temperature of about 10 million degrees Celsius. Beyond that, additional heating systems are needed to achieve the temperatures necessary for fusion. In stellarators, these heating systems have to supply all the energy needed.The tokamak (_toroidalnya kamera ee magnetnaya katushka_ – torus-shaped magnetic chamber) was designed in 1951 by Soviet physicists Andrei Sakharov and Igor Tamm. Tokamaks operate within limited parameters outside which sudden losses of energy confinement (disruptions) can occur, causing major thermal and mechanical stresses to the structure and walls. Nevertheless, it is considered the most promising design, and research is continuing on various tokamaks around the world.Research is also being carried out on several types of stellarator. Lyman Spitzer devised and began work on the first fusion device – a stellarator – at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory in 1951. Due to the difficulty in confining plasmas, stellarators fell out of favour until computer modelling techniques allowed accurate geometries to be calculated. Because stellarators have no toroidal plasma current, plasma stability is increased compared with tokamaks. Since the burning plasma can be more easily controlled and monitored, stellerators have an intrinsic potential for steady-state, continuous operation. The disadvantage is that, due to their more complex shape, stellarators are much more complex than tokamaks to design and build.RFP devices differ from tokamaks mainly in the spatial distribution of the toroidal magnetic field, which changes sign at the edge of the plasma. The RFX machine in Padua, Italy is used to study the physical problems arising from the spontaneous reorganization of the magnetic field, which is an intrinsic feature of this configuration.### Inertial confinementIn inertial confinement fusion, which is a newer line of research, laser or ion beams are focused very precisely onto the surface of a target, which is a pellet of D-T fuel, a few millimetres in diameter. This heats the outer layer of the material, which explodes outwards generating an inward-moving compression front or implosion that compresses and heats the inner layers of material. The core of the fuel may be compressed to one thousand times its liquid density, resulting in conditions where fusion can occur. The energy released then would heat the surrounding fuel, which may also undergo fusion leading to a chain reaction (known as ignition) as the reaction spreads outwards through the fuel. The time required for these reactions to occur is limited by the inertia of the fuel (hence the name), but is less than a microsecond. So far, most inertial confinement work has involved lasers.Recent work at Osaka University\\\\\\'s Institute of Laser Engineering in Japan suggests that ignition may be achieved at lower temperature with a second very intense laser pulse guided through a millimetre-high gold cone into the compressed fuel, and timed to coincide with the peak compression. This technique, known as \\\\\\'fast ignition\\\\\\', means that fuel compression is separated from hot spot generation with ignition, making the process more practical.In the UK  based near Oxford is researching inertial fusion energy (IFE) with a focus on power driver technology using an asymmetric implosion approach. As well as power generation, the company envisages material processing and chemical manufacturing applications. In March 2025 the company announced that it would focus on providing its amplifier technology, dropping earlier plans to develop a power plant.The US  is a large laser-based inertial confinement fusion research device at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. It focuses 192 powerful laser beams into a small target in a few billionths of a second, delivering more than 2 MJ of ultraviolet energy and 500 TW of peak power.A completely different concept, the \\\\\\'Z-pinch\\\\\\' (or \\\\\\'zeta pinch\\\\\\'), uses a strong electrical current in a plasma to generate X-rays, which compress a tiny D-T fuel cylinder.### Magnetized target fusionMagnetized target fusion (MTF), also referred to as magneto-inertial fusion (MIF), is a pulsed approach to fusion that combines the compressional heating of inertial confinement fusion with the magnetically reduced thermal transport and magnetically enhanced alpha heating of magnetic confinement fusion.A range of MTF systems are currently being experimented with, and commonly use a magnetic field to confine a plasma with compressional heating provided by laser, electromagnetic or mechanical liner implosion. As a result of this combined approach, shorter plasma confinement times are required than for magnetic confinement (from 100 ns to 1 ms, depending on the MIF approach), reducing the requirement to stabilize the plasma for long periods. Conversely, compression can be achieved over timescales longer than those typical for inertial confinement, making it possible to achieve compression through mechanical, magnetic, chemical, or relatively low-powered laser drivers.Several approaches are underway to examine MTF, including experiments at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratory, the University of Rochester, and private companies General Fusion and Helion Energy.R&D challenges for MTF include whether a suitable target plasma can be formed and heated to fusion conditions while avoiding contamination from the liner, as with magnetic confinement and inertial confinement. Due to the reduced demands on confinement time and compression velocities, MTF has been pursued as a lower-cost and simpler approach to investigating these challenges than conventional fusion projects.In the UK General Fusion\\\\\\'s  at the UK Atomic Energy Authority\\\\\\'s Culham Campus, near Oxford, received planning consent for construction in January 2022. The company aims to construct a fusion energy power plant by the early 2030s.### Hybrid fusionFusion can also be combined with fission in what is referred to as hybrid nuclear fusion where the blanket surrounding the core is a subcritical fission reactor. The fusion reaction acts as a source of neutrons for the surrounding blanket, where these neutrons are captured, resulting in fission reactions taking place. These fission reactions would also produce more neutrons, thereby assisting further fission reactions in the blanket.The concept of hybrid fusion can be compared with an accelerator-driven system (ADS), where an accelerator is the source of neutrons for the blanket assembly, rather than nuclear fusion reactions (see page on ). The blanket of a hybrid fusion system can therefore contain the same fuel as an ADS – for example, the abundant element thorium or the long-lived heavy isotopes present in used nuclear fuel (from a conventional reactor) could be used as fuel.The blanket containing fission fuel in a hybrid fusion system would not require the development of new materials capable of withstanding constant neutron bombardment, whereas such materials would be needed in the blanket of a \\\\\\'conventional\\\\\\' fusion system. A further advantage of a hybrid system is that the fusion part would not need to produce as many neutrons as a (non-hybrid) fusion reactor would in order to generate more power than is consumed – so a commercial-scale fusion reactor in a hybrid system does not need to be as large as a fusion-only reactor.Fusion research---------------A long-standing quip about fusion points out that, since the 1970s, commercial deployment of fusion power has always been about 40 years away. While there is some truth in this, many breakthroughs have been made, particularly in recent years, and there are a number of major projects under development that may bring research to the point where fusion power can be commercialized.Several **tokamaks** have been built, including the Joint European Torus (JET)\\\\xa0and the Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak (MAST)\\\\xa0in the UK and the tokamak fusion test reactor (TFTR) at Princeton in the USA. The ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) project currently under construction in Cadarache, France will be the largest tokamak when it operates in the 2020s. The Chinese Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR) is a tokamak which is reported to be larger than ITER, and due for completion in 2030.\\\\xa0Meanwhile it is running its Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST). In the UK, Tokamak Energy has commissioned and is further developing its ST40 tokamak.\\\\xa0In March 2022 the US Department of Energy announced up to $50 million of federal funding to support US scientists conducting experimental research in fusion energy science. $20 million of this would support tokamak facilities, while the other $30 million would support\\\\xa0research to improve fusion performance and increase the duration of burning plasma scenarios.Much research has also been carried out on **stellarators**. A large one of these, the Large Helical Device at Japan\\\\\\'s National Institute of Fusion Research, began operating in 1998. It is being used to study the best magnetic configuration for plasma confinement. At the Garching site of the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Germany, research carried out at the Wendelstein 7-AS between 1988 and 2002 is being progressed at the Wendelstein 7-X, which was built over 19 years at Max Planck Institute\\\\\\'s Greifswald site and started up at the end of 2015. Another stellarator, TJII, is in operation in Madrid, Spain. In the USA, at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, where the first stellarators were built in 1951, construction on the NCSX stellerator was abandoned in 2008 due to cost overruns and lack of funding.There have also been significant developments in research into **inertial fusion energy** (IFE). Construction of the\\\\xa0$7 billion National Ignition Facility (NIF) at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), funded by the National Nuclear Security Administration, was completed in March 2009. The Laser Mégajoule (LMJ) in France’s Bordeaux region started operation in October 2014. Both are designed to deliver, in a few billionths of a second, nearly two million joules of light energy to targets measuring a few millimeters in size. The main purpose of both NIF and LMJ is\\\\xa0for research to support both countries\\\\\\' respective\\\\xa0nuclear weapons programs.In September 2021 the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) opened the Fusion Technology Facility at the Advanced Manufacturing Park in Rotherham. It will house test rigs including the Combined Heating and Magnetic Research Apparatus (CHIMERA), which would be the only device capable of\\\\xa0simulating\\\\xa0conditions of a fusion power plant to test prototype components.### ITERIn 1985, the Soviet Union suggested building a next generation tokamak with Europe, Japan and the USA. Collaboration was established under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Between 1988 and 1990, the initial designs were drawn up for an International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER, which also means \\\\\\'a path\\\\\\' or \\\\\\'journey\\\\\\' in Latin) with the aim of proving that fusion could produce useful energy. The four parties agreed in 1992 to collaborate further on engineering design activities for ITER. Canada and Kazakhstan are also involved through Euratom and Russia, respectively.Six years later, the ITER Council approved the first comprehensive design of a fusion reactor based on well-established physics and technology with a price tag of $6 billion. Then the USA decided pull out of the project, forcing a 50% reduction in costs and a redesign. The result was the ITER Fusion Energy Advanced Tokomak (ITER-FEAT) – initially expected to cost $3 billion but still achieve the targets of a self-sustaining reaction and a net energy gain. The envisaged energy gain is unlikely to be enough for a power plant, but it should demonstrate feasibility.In 2003, the USA rejoined the project and China also announced it would join. After deadlocked discussion, the six partners agreed in mid-2005 to site ITER at Cadarache, in southern France. The deal involved major concessions to Japan, which had put forward Rokkasho as a preferred site. The European Union (EU) and France would contribute half of the then estimated €12.8 billion total cost, with the other partners – Japan, China, South Korea, USA and Russia – putting in 10% each. Japan will provide a lot of the high-tech components, will host a €1 billion materials testing facility – the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF) – and will have the right to host a subsequent demonstration fusion reactor. India became the seventh member of the ITER consortium at the end of 2005. In November 2006, the seven members – China, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea, the USA and the European Union – signed the ITER implementing agreement.\\\\xa0The total cost of the 500 MW ITER comprises about half for the ten-year construction and half for 20 years of operation.Site preparation works at Cadarache commenced in January 2007. First concrete for the buildings was poured in December 2013. Experiments were due to begin in 2018, when hydrogen will be used to avoid activating the magnets, but this is now expected in 2035. The first D-T plasma is not expected until 2035.\\\\xa0ITER is large because confinement time increases with the cube of machine size. The vacuum vessel will be 19 m across and 11 m high, and weigh more than 5000 tonnes.The goal of ITER is to operate with a plasma thermal output of 500 MW (for at least 400 seconds continuously) with less than 50 MW of plasma heating power input. No electricity will be generated at ITER.An associated CEA facility at Cadarache is WEST, formerly Tore Supra, which is designed to test prototype components and accelerate their development for ITER. It is focused on the divertor structure to remove helium, testing the durability of tungsten materials used.A 2 GW Demonstration Power Plant, known as Demo, is expected to demonstrate large-scale production of electrical power on a continual basis. The conceptual design of Demo was expected to be completed by 2017, with construction beginning around 2024 and the first phase of operation commencing from 2033. It has since been delayed, with construction now planned for after 2040.In November 2022 it was announced that a defect had been discovered in the thermal shields and vacuum vessel of ITER. The bending and welding of cooling fluid in pipes to the thermal shield panels\\\\xa0resulted in stress corrosion cracking of up to 2.2mm deep in the pipes. Due to the risk of leaking, the installed module will\\\\xa0need to be lifted out and disassembled\\\\xa0in order to proceed with the repairs. ITER director general Pietro Barabaschi\\\\xa0said the consequences on schedule and cost \"will not be insignificant\". In March 2025 the manufacturing of the second vaccum vessel was completed.### JETIn 1978, the European Community (Euratom, along with Sweden and Switzerland) launched the Joint European Torus (JET) project in the UK. JET is the largest tokamak operating in the world today. A similar tokamak, JT-60, operates at the Naka Fusion Institute of Japan Atomic Energy Agency in Japan, but only JET has the facilities to use D-T fuel.Following a legal dispute with Euratom, in December 1999 JET\\\\\\'s international contract ended and the UKAEA\\\\xa0took over the management of JET on behalf of its European partners. From that time JET\\\\\\'s experimental programme has been co-ordinated by the European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA) parties.\\\\xa0JET is operated by the UKAEA\\\\\\'s Culham Centre for Fusion Research, a member of the EUROfusion consortium.JET produced its first plasma in 1983, and became the first experiment to produce controlled fusion power in November 1991, albeit with high input of electricity. Up to 16 MW of fusion power for one second and 5 MW sustained has been achieved in D-T plasmas using the device, from 24 MW of power injected into its heating system, and many experiments are conducted to study different heating schemes and other techniques. JET has been very successful in operating remote handling techniques in a radioactive environment to modify the interior of the device and has shown that the remote handling maintenance of fusion devices is realistic.JET is a key device in preparations for ITER. It has been significantly upgraded in recent years to test ITER plasma physics and engineering systems. Further enhancements are planned at JET with a view to exceeding its fusion power record in future D-T experiments. A compact device – Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak (MAST) – was developed alongside JET at Culham, partly to serve the ITER project, and the substantial\\\\xa0MAST Upgrade\\\\xa0project is now being implemented in stages to increase neutral beam power from 5 to 12.5 MW and the energy deposited in plasma from 2.5 to 30 MJ. MAST Upgrade is focused on designing a plasma exhaust system or divertor that would be able withstand the intense power loads created in commercial-sized fusion reactors. It achieved first plasma in October 2020.In 2019 the UK government committed £22 million over four years for the conceptual design of the Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP) at Culham. The technical objectives of STEP are: to deliver predictable net electricity greater than 100 MW; to exploit fusion energy beyond electricity production; to ensure tritium self-sufficiency; to qualify materials and components under appropriate fusion conditions of neutron flux; and to develop a viable path to affordable life-cycle costs. STEP is scheduled for completion in 2040.\\\\xa0In February 2022 researchers at JET achieved 59 megajoules of heat energy from fusion over a five-second period, doubling previous records.### Tokamak EnergyTokamak Energy in the UK is a private company developing a spherical tokamak, and hopes to commercialize this by 2030. The company grew out of Culham laboratory, home to JET, and its technology revolves around high temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets, which allow for relatively low-power and small-size devices, but high performance and potentially widespread commercial deployment. Its first tokamak with exclusively HTS magnets\\\\xa0– the ST25 HTS, Tokamak Energy\\\\\\'s second reactor\\\\xa0– demonstrated 29 hours\\\\\\' continuous plasma during the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition in London in 2015, a world record.The next reactor is the ST40 at Milton Park in Oxfordshire, which achieved first plasma in April 2017. It produced plasma temperatures of 15 million degrees Celsius in 2018 and 2019 after the commissioning of further magnetic coils. Chief executive of Tokamak Energy David Kingham said: \"The ST40 is designed to achieve 100 million degrees C and get within a factor of ten of energy break-even conditions.” The company is working with Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory on spherical tokamaks, and with the Plasma Science and Fusion Centre at MIT on HTS magnets.\\\\xa0In July 2020 it was awarded £10 million from the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), as part of the government’s Advanced Modular Reactor project. The funds will contribute to core development work on high temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets and plasma exhaust system (divertor) technologies. The divertor must handle high levels of heat and particle bombardment while removing impurities and waste from the system. It aims to have a prototype delivering electricity to the grid by 2030.### KSTARThe KSTAR (Korean Superconducting Tokamak Reactor) at the National Fusion Research Institute (NFRI) in Daejeon produced its first plasma in mid-2008. It is a pilot device for ITER, and involves much international collaboration. It will be a satellite of ITER during ITER’s operational phase. The tokamak with 1.8 metre major radius is the first to use Nb3Sn superconducting magnets, the same material to be used in the ITER project. Its first stage of development to 2012 was to prove baseline operation technologies and achieved plasma pulses of up to 20 seconds. For the second phase of development (2013-2017), KSTAR was upgraded to study long pulses of up to 300 seconds in H mode – the 100s target was in 2015 – and embark upon high-performance AT mode. It achieved 70 seconds in high-performance plasma operation in late 2016, a world record. In addition, KSTAR researchers also succeeded in achieving an alternative advanced plasma operation mode with the internal transport barrier (ITB). This is a steep pressure gradient in the core of the plasmas due to the enhanced core plasma confinement. NFRI said this is the first ITB operation achieved in the superconducting device at the lowest heating power. KSTAR Phase 3 (2018-2023) is to develop high performance, high efficiency AT mode technologies with long-pulse operation. Phase 4 (2023-2025) will test DEMO-related prior arts. The device does not have tritium handling capabilities, so will not use D-T fuel.### K-DEMO tokamakIn collaboration with the US Department of Energy\\\\\\'s Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) in New Jersey and South Korea’s National Fusion Research Institute (NFRI) K-DEMO is intended to be the next step toward commercial reactors from ITER, and would be the first plant to actually contribute power to an electric grid. According to the PPPL, it would generate \"some 1 billion watts of power for several weeks on end\", a much greater output than ITER\\\\\\'s goal of producing 500 million watts for 500 seconds by the late 2020s. K-DEMO is expected to have a 6.65m diameter major radius tokamak, and a test blanket module as part of the DEMO breeding blanket R&D. The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology plans to invest about KRW 1 trillion (US$ 941 million) in the project. About KRW 300 billion of that spending has already been funded. The government expects the project to employ nearly 2,400 people in the first phase, which will last throughout 2016. K-DEMO is expected to have an initial operational phase from about 2037 to 2050 to develop components for the second stage, which would produce electricity.### FAST (Fusion by Advanced Superconducting Tokamak)FAST aims to generate and sustain a plasma of deuterium-tritium (D-T) reactions, demonstrating an integrated fusion energy system that combines energy conversion including electricity generation and fuel technologies. To be sited in Japan, the project aims for power generation demonstration by the end of the 2030s. The aim is for power generation of 50 to 100 MW with 1000 seconds of D-T fusion burn, with the device planned to operate for a cumulative 1000 hours of full-power operation.EASTIn China the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) at China Academy of Sciences\\\\\\' Hefei Institutes of Physical Science (HFIPS) produced hydrogen plasma at 50 million degrees Celsius and held it for 102 seconds in 2017. In November 2018 it achieved 100 million degrees Celsius for 10 seconds, with input of 10 MW of electric power. In July 2020 EAST achieved a completely non-inductive, current-driven, steady-state plasma for over 100 seconds, claimed as a breakthrough with significant implications for the future China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR). In May 2021 it set a new world record of achieving a plasma temperature of 120 million degrees Celsius for 101 seconds. The experiment also realized a plasma temperature of 160 million degrees Celsius, lasting 20 seconds.TFTRIn the USA, the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) operated at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) from 1982 to 1997. In December 1993, TFTR became the first magnetic fusion device to perform extensive experiments with plasmas composed of D-T. The following year TFTR produced 10.7 MW of controlled fusion power – a record at that time. TFTR set other records, including the achievement of a plasma temperature of 510 million degrees centigrade in 1995. However, it did not achieve its goal of break-even fusion energy (where the energy input required is no greater than the amount of fusion energy produced), but achieved all of its hardware design goals, thus making substantial contributions to the development of ITER.ALCATORAt the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) since the 1970s a succession of small ALCATOR (Alto Campus Torus) high magnetic field torus reactors have operated on the principle of achieving high plasma pressure as the route to long plasma confinement. Alcator C-Mod is claimed to have the highest magnetic field and highest plasma pressure of any fusion reactor, and is the largest university-based fusion reactor in the world. It operated 1993-2016. In September 2016 it achieved a plasma pressure of 2.05 atmospheres at a temperature of 35 million degrees Celsius. The plasma produced 300 trillion fusion reactions per second and had a central magnetic field strength of 5.7 tesla. It carried 1.4 million amps of electrical current and was heated with over 4 MW of power. The reaction occurred in a volume of approximately 1 cubic metre and the plasma lasted for two seconds. Having achieved this record performance for a fusion reactor, government funding ceased.A scaled-up version planned to be built at Triotsk near Moscow in collaboration with the Kurchatov Institute is Ignitor, with 1.3 m diameter torus.### Large Helical Device\\\\xa0– stellaratorThe Large Helical Device (LHD) at Japan\\\\\\'s National Institute for Fusion Science in Toki, in the Gifu Prefecture, was the world\\\\\\'s largest stellarator. LHD produced its first plasma in 1998 and has demonstrated plasma confinement properties comparable to other large fusion devices. It has achieved an ion temperature of 13.5 keV (about 160 million degrees) and plasma stored energy of 1.44 million joules (MJ).### Wendelstein 7-X stellaratorFollowing a year of tests, this started up at the end of 2015, and helium plasma briefly reached about one million degrees centigrade.\\\\xa0In 2016 it progressed to using hydrogen, and using 2 MW it achieved plasma of 80 million degrees centigrade for a quarter of a second. W7-X is the world’s largest stellarator and it is planned to operate continuously for up to 30 minutes. It cost €1 billion ($1.1 billion).\\\\xa0\\\\xa0  Some good diagrams are in a\\\\xa0\\\\xa0on the Wendelstein 7-X.### Heliac-1 stellaratorAt the\\\\xa0Australian Plasma Fusion Research Facility\\\\xa0at the Australian National University the H-1 stellarator has run for some years and in 2014 was upgraded significantly. H-1 is capable of accessing a wide range of plasma configurations and allows exploration of ideas for improved magnetic design of the fusion power stations that will follow ITER.### National\\\\xa0Ignition\\\\xa0Facility\\\\xa0– laserThe world\\\\\\'s most powerful laser fusion facility, the $4 billion National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), was completed in March 2009. Using its 192 laser beams, NIF is able to deliver more than 60 times the energy of any previous laser system to its target. LLNL announced in July 2012 that in \"an historic record-breaking laser shot, the NIF laser system of 192 beams delivered more than 500 TW of peak power and 1.85 megajoules (MJ) of ultraviolet laser light to its (2mm diameter) target\" for a few trillionths of a second. In September 2013 for the first time the amount of energy released through the fusion reaction (14 kJ) exceeded the amount of energy being absorbed by the fuel, but not the amount supplied by the giant lasers (1.8 MJ). In August 2021 LLNL said that it had achieved a yield of 1.3 MJ, much better than its previous best of 55 kJ in 2018. It said this was \"a historic step forward for inertial confinment\" putting it \"at the threshold of fusion ignition.\"\\\\xa0In August 2021 NIF achieved a record fusion yield of 1.3 megajoules – 24 times greater than its previous best experiment – which LLNL said places it \"at the threshold of fusion ignition\".\\\\xa0A breakthrough in December 2022 resulted in an NIF experiment demonstrating the fundamental scientific basis for inertial confinement fusion energy for the first time. The experiment created fusion ignition when using 192 laser beams to deliver more than 2 MJ of ultraviolet energy to a deuterium-tritium fuel pellet.An earlier high-power laser at LLNL, Nova, was built in 1984 for the purpose of achieving ignition. Nova failed to do this and was closed in 1999, but provided essential data that led to the design of NIF. Nova also generated considerable amounts of data on high-density matter physics, which is useful both in fusion power and nuclear weapons research.In connection with NIF, LLNL is developing the Laser Inertial Fusion Engine (LIFE), a hybrid fusion system where neutrons resulting from laser fusion would drive a subcritical nuclear fission blanket to generate electricity. The blanket would contain either depleted uranium; used nuclear fuel; natural uranium or thorium; or plutonium-239, minor actinides and fission products from reprocessed used nuclear fuel.### Laser MégajouleMeanwhile, the French Atomic Energy Commission (Commissariat à l\\\\\\'énergie atomique, CEA) has operated a similar size laser – the Laser Mégajoule (LMJ) – near Bordeaux since 2014. Its 240 laser beams are able to generate 1.8 MJ pulses for a few billionths of a second, concentrated on a small deuterium and tritium target. A prototype laser, the Ligne d\\\\\\'Integration Laser (LIL), commenced operation in 2003.### SG-IIChina’s National Laboratory of High-Power Laser and Physics, associated with the China Academy of Science, has a laser inertial confinement experiment in Shanghai – the Shenguang-II eight-beam laser facility (SG-II), similar to the National Ignition Facility in the USA and Laser Mégajoule in France. It is the only high power neodymium-glass solid laser facility with an active probe light in China.\\\\u202fIn 2005 a ninth beam was added, advancing the capacity for fusion research. The SG-II facility is China’s high-power laser technology international demonstration base.### PETAL and HiPER lasersThe Petawatt Aquitaine Laser (PETAL) laser facility is a high energy multi-petawatt laser (3.5 kJ energy with a duration of 0.5 to 5 ps) under construction near Bordeaux, on the same site as LIL. PETAL will be coupled with LIL to demonstrate the physics and laser technology of fast ignition.The High Power Laser Energy Research Facility (HiPER) is being designed to build on the research planned at the PETAL project. HiPER will use a long pulse laser (currently estimated at 200kJ) combined with a 70kJ short pulse laser. A three-year preparatory phase that commenced in 2008 has direct funding or in-kind commitments amounting to around €70 million from several countries. The detailed engineering phase is projected to begin in 2011, with a six-year construction phase possibly commencing by 2014.### Z machineOperated by Sandia National Laboratories, the Z machine is the largest X-ray generator in the world. As with NIF, the facility was built as part of the country\\\\\\'s Stockpile Stewardship Program, which aims to maintain the stockpile of nuclear weapons without the need for full-scale testing.Conditions for fusion are achieved by passing a powerful electrical pulse (lasting less than 100 nanoseconds) through a set of fine tungsten wires inside a metal hohlraum. The wires turn into a plasma and experience a compression (\\\\\\'Z-pinch\\\\\\'), forcing the vapourized particles to collide with each other, thereby producing intense X-ray radiation. A tiny cylinder containing fusion fuel placed inside the hohlraum would therefore be compressed by the X-rays, allowing fusion to occur.In 2006, Z machine had achieved temperatures of over 2 billion degrees, considerably higher than what is needed for fusion, and in theory high enough to allow nuclear fusion of hydrogen with heavier elements such as lithium or boron.### Other fusion projectsThere is a considerable amount of research into many other fusion projects at various stages of development.**Lockheed CFR**. Lockheed Martin at its so-called ‘skunk works’ is developing a  (CFR) which uses conventional D-T plasma in evacuated containment but confines it differently. Instead of constraining the plasma within tubular rings, a series of superconducting coils will generate a new magnetic-field geometry in which the plasma is held within the broader confines of the entire reaction chamber. The energy is supplied by radiofrequency heating. Superconducting magnets within the coils will generate a magnetic field around the outer border of the chamber. The aim is to go to plasma pressure being as great as confining pressure at high enough temperature for ignition and net energy yield. Heat exchangers in the reactor wall would convey energy to a gas turbine. It has progressed to a magentized ion confinement experiment, but has some way to go before any prototype, which they claim will be very much smaller than conventional designs such as the ITER tokamak.Italy\\\\\\'s National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA) is developing a small tokamak reactor by the name of **Ignitor**. Under an Italian-Russian agreement signed in May 2010, a reactor will be assembled in Italy and installed at the Kurchatov Institute\\\\\\'s Troitsk Institute for Innovation and Fusion Research (TRINITI) near Moscow.An alternative to using powerful lasers for inertial confinement fusion is \\\\\\'**heavy ion fusion**\\\\\\', where high-energy particles from an accelerator are focused using magnetic fields onto the fusion target.\\\\xa0The  (Neutralized Drift Compression Experiment II) accelerator has been used for heavy ion fusion experiments since 2012 at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. It is being expanded to deliver short intense pulses of ion beams with kinetic energy of 1.2 MeV. High-energy-density physics (HEDP) experiments with laboratory plasmas is a growing part of inertial fusion energy (IFE) physics. (Lawrenceville Plasma Physics) is a US enterprise developing aneutronic fusion using a dense plasma focus device (DPF or **focus fusion**) and hydrogen-boron fuel. The hydrogen and boron (B-11) as plasma fuse at high temperature to form a pulsed beam of helium nuclei without emitting neutrons. (The boron and hydrogen combine to produce a brief intermediate carbon-12 atom which rapidly decays to three alpha particles.) This charged high-energy ion beam generates electricity as it passes through a series of coils similar to a transformer, at 80% efficiency. The balance of energy is as by-product X-rays which are captured in an array of photoelectric receptors. LPP Fusion has achieved electron energies of 400 keV.Another line of fusion research using lasers also involves fusing hydrogen and boron-11 to produce helium nuclei, which continue the chain reaction from boron. One laser generates a powerful magnetic confinement field in a coil to trap the fusion reaction in a small area for a nanosecond, while a second more powerful laser triggers the nuclear fusion process. Early H-11B fusion trials at the Prague Asterix Laser System, using high-energy iodine lasers, have generated more energy than needed to trigger the fusion process.\\\\xa0in Australia develops this and is aiming to use non-thermal laser technology to fuse hydrogen and boron-11. A nanosecond laser pulse ignites a H-B fusion reaction, then a second laser and capacitive coil produce a kilotesla magnetic field to increase the reaction yield. This step is now the focus of research. The yield is increased further by a chain reaction to create helium nuclei which are captured in a charged sphere of at least two metres diameter to produce electricity directly, without any steam circuit. The 2.9 MeV alpha particles represent up to 300 kWh of energy per 15 mg H-11B fuel. A new project is developing fuel materials by synthesizing boron-11-enriched hydrogen borides and hydrogen-adsorbed boron nitride nanosheets. These will be tested at laser facilities overseas.The **Polywell** (\\\\\\'polyhedron\\\\\\' combined with \\\\\\'potential well\\\\\\')\\\\xa0device\\\\xa0consists of magnetic coils arranged in a polyhedral configuration of six sides, forming a cube. A cloud of electrons is confined in the middle of the device so as to be able to accelerate and confine the positive ions to be fused. This electrostatic confinement concept differs from traditional magnetic confinement because the fields do not need to confine ions\\\\xa0– only electrons.  has been researching the Polywell concept and looking at hydrogen and boron as fuel for aneutronic fusion. This followed some years of development by the US Navy, using deuterium fuel.**** is one of a number of private efforts to develop a commercial fusion power plant. The company’s magnetized target fusion (MTF) approach generates a compact toroid plasma in an injector, containing and compressing it using a magnetic field before injecting it into a spherical compression chamber. The chamber holds a liquid lead-lithium liner which is pumped to create a vortex, into which the plasma target is injected. A synchronized array of pistons firing simultaneously creates a spherical compression wave in the liquid metal, compressing the plasma target and heating it to fusion conditions. Founded in Canada in 2002, General Fusion is funded by a syndicate of private investors, energy venture capital companies, sovereign wealth funds and the Canadian government’s Sustainable Development Technology Canada (SDTC) fund. A further government grant was announced in October 2018, from the Strategic Innovation Fund. The company has demonstrated milestones including creating 200-300 eV magnetized spheromak plasmas and confining them for over 500 µs.Much of current work underway on MTF is derived from programmes at the Soviet Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy, under E. P. Velikhov, circa 1970. This inspired the LINUS project at the Naval Research Laboratory in the USA, and later the fast-liner project at Los Alamos.General Atomics has operated the  tokamak in San Diego for the US Department of Energy since the late 1980s. It aims to establish the scientific basis for optimizing the tokamak approach to fusion energy production.### Cold fusionIn March 1989, spectacular claims were made for another approach, when two researchers, in the USA (Stanley Pons) and the UK (Martin Fleischmann), claimed to have achieved fusion in a simple tabletop apparatus working at room temperature. \\\\\\'N-Fusion\\\\\\', or \\\\\\'cold fusion\\\\\\', involves the electrolysis of heavy water using palladium electrodes on which deuterium nuclei are said to concentrate at very high densities. The researchers claimed that heat – which could only be explained in terms of nuclear processes – was produced, as well as fusion byproducts, including helium, tritium and neutrons. Other experimenters failed to replicate this, however, and most of the scientific community no longer considers it a real phenomenon.### Low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR)Initiated by claims for ‘cold fusion’, research at the nanotechnology level is continuing on low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR) which apparently use weak nuclear interactions (rather than strong force as in nuclear fission or fusion) to create low-energy neutrons, followed by neutron capture processes resulting in isotopic change or transmutation, without the emission of strong prompt radiation. LENR experiments involve hydrogen or deuterium permeation through a catalytic layer and reaction with a metal. Researchers report that energy is released, though on any reproducible basis, very little more than is input. The main practical example is hydrogen plus nickel powder evidently giving more heat than can be explained on any chemical basis.The Japanese government is sponsoring LENR research\\\\xa0– notably a nano-metal hydrogen energy project (MHE)\\\\xa0– through its New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), and Mitsubishi is also active in research.\\\\xa0Over 2015-2019 Google funded 30 researchers on three projects and found no evidence that LENR is possible, but they made some advances in measurement and materials science techniques. There was some indication that the two projects involving palladium merited further study.Assessing fusion power----------------------The use of fusion power plants could substantially reduce the environmental impacts of increasing world electricity demands since, like nuclear fission power, they would not contribute to acid rain or the greenhouse effect. Fusion power could easily satisfy the energy needs associated with continued economic growth, given the ready availability of fuels. There would be no danger of a runaway fusion reaction as this is intrinsically impossible and any malfunction would result in a rapid shutdown of the plant.However, although fusion does not generate long-lived radioactive products and the unburned gases can be treated on site, there would a short- to medium-term radioactive waste problem due to activation of the structural materials. Some component materials will become radioactive during the lifetime of a reactor, due to bombardment with high-energy neutrons, and will eventually become radioactive waste. The volume of such waste would be similar to the corresponding volumes from fission reactors. However, the long-term radiotoxicity of the fusion wastes would be considerably lower than that from actinides in used fission fuel, and the activation product wastes would be handled in much the same way as those from fission reactors with some years of operation..There are also other concerns, principally regarding the possible release of tritium into the environment. It is radioactive and very difficult to contain since it can penetrate concrete, rubber and some grades of steel. As an isotope of hydrogen, it is easily incorporated into water, making the water itself weakly radioactive. With a half-life of about 12.3 years, the presence of tritium remains a threat to health for about 125 years after it is created, as a gas or in water, if at high levels. It can be inhaled, absorbed through the skin or ingested. Inhaled tritium spreads throughout the soft tissues and tritiated water mixes quickly with all the water in the body. Although there is only a small inventory of tritium in a fusion reactor – a few grams – each could conceivably release significant quantities of tritium during operation through routine leaks, assuming the best containment systems. An accident could release even more. This is one reason why long-term hopes are for the deuterium-deuterium fusion process, dispensing with tritium.While fusion power clearly has much to offer when the technology is eventually developed, the problems associated with it also need to be addressed if it is to become a widely used future energy source.* * *Notes & References------------------### Notesa. The nucleus of deuterium (D) consists of one proton and one neutron, whereas hydrogen only has one proton. Tritium (T) has one proton and two neutrons. When the nuclei of D and T fuse, helium-4 (two protons and two neutrons) is formed, along with a free neutron. The 17.6 MeV of energy released in the fusion reaction takes the form of kinetic energy, the helium having 3.5 MeV and the neutron 14.1 MeV. The products of the fusion reaction have a total mass that is slightly lower than the starting materials (D and T), this decrease in mass having been converted to energy according to E=mc2. ]b. Tritium can be produced by bombardment of lithium-6 with neutrons of any energy. When lithium-6 (three protons, three neutrons) absorbs a neutron it splits into helium (two protons, two neutrons) and tritium (one proton, two neutrons), along with the release of 4.8 MeV of energy. Tritium can also be produced from the more-abundant lithium-7 from high-energy neutrons. Hence, natural lithium can be used for tritium generation in a fusion reactor. According to the European Commission: \"A 1 GW (electric) fusion plant will need about 100 kg deuterium and 3 tons of natural lithium to operate for a whole year, generating about 7 billion kWh.\" ]c. The European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA) was established to provide a framework for magnetic confinement fusion research within the European Union and Switzerland. ]d. The Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory has a webpage on TFTR\\\\xa0]e. The first inertial confinement fusion experiments at NIF (see  will use the \\\\\\'indirect drive\\\\\\' method, which differs from the \\\\\\'direct drive\\\\\\' method described in the main text. In the indirect drive method, the lasers are focused on a gold cavity (known as a _hohlraum_) containing the fuel pellet. The lasers rapidly heat the inside surface of the hohlraum, generating X-rays that cause a blowoff of the capsule surface, in turn causing the fuel capsule to implode in the same way as if it had been hit with the lasers directly. It is hoped that NIF will be the first laser in which the energy released from the fusion fuel will exceed the laser energy used to produce the fusion reaction. ]f. Z machine was designed to supply X-ray pulses of 50 terawatts, but improvements allowed pulses of 290 terawatts. Following a major refurbishment in 2007, Z machine\\\\\\'s electrical pulse was increased from 18 million amps to 26 million amps delivered over a few nanoseconds. ]g. A _hohlraum_ is a metal cavity used in \\\\\\'indirect drive\\\\\\' methods for inertial confinement fusion – see Note e above. ]### References1.

(Image: A. Barber Huescar/IAEA)Newly released nuclear power data for 2023 collected by the IAEA, paint a picture of a clean energy technology at a crossroads amid the  to accelerate its deployment.Electricity production from nuclear power rose by 2.6 per cent last year compared to 2022, according to the operating data provided by IAEA Member States to the Power Reactor Information System (PRIS) — the IAEA’s comprehensive and publicly available database on nuclear power. Nuclear power continued to generate almost 10 percent of the world’s electricity and a quarter of all low carbon electricity last year, according to the data, which are featured in two newly released annual IAEA publications: Nuclear Power Reactors in the World () and Operating Experience with Nuclear Power Stations in Member States ().The USA remained the world’s top producer of nuclear electricity, followed by China and France. China continued to lead in newbuilds, beginning construction on five reactors. Newcomer Egypt started building its second reactor, according to the data, which showed the global fleet operating at nearly full strength with a median capacity factor of 88 per cent. While new grid connections were made at nuclear power plants in Belarus, China, Republic of Korea, Slovakia and the United States of America, reactors were shut down in Belgium, China and Germany.The 2023 data come against the backdrop of growing global ambitions for nuclear technology amid an aging reactor fleet. More than two-thirds of reactors are at least 30 years old. In December 2023, in the historic first Global Stocktake at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai, the 198 signatory countries to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change called for accelerating the deployment of low-emission energy technologies including nuclear power for deep and rapid decarbonization, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as industry. In addition, more than 20 countries at COP28 pledged to work towards tripling global nuclear power capacity to reach net zero by 2050.“IAEA data shows the global fleet of nuclear reactors continues to be a large and indispensable source of low-carbon electricity,” said IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi. “But it’s also clear that we will need to extend the lives of existing reactors, replace retiring facilities with new ones, and add a lot of new capacity so that global climate change and energy security goals can be reached.”]( Nuclear Power Development and Operating Experience Highlights------------------------------------------------------------------**Nuclear power status and trends**]( Taiwan, China - nuclear electricity produced:17.2 TWh, share of nuclear electricity produced: 6.9 per cent. Ukraine has not submitted 2023 data by the time of publication]( of the end of December 2023, global operational nuclear power capacity was 371.5 GW(e), provided by 413 reactors in 31 countries. However, only 403 reactors, with a combined capacity of 364.5 GW(e), reported their electricity production to the IAEA. Twenty-five reactors remained in suspended operations throughout the year, despite being licenced for operation. This includes four reactors in India with a combined net capacity of 639 MW(e) and 21 reactors in Japan with a combined net capacity of around 21 000 MW(e). Japan restarted two reactors in 2023, Takahama-1 and Takahama-2, which had been in suspended operation since 2011.Nuclear power capacity has remained at a consistent level over the past decade, with an additional 69.8 GW(e) nuclear capacity connected to the grid since the beginning of 2013. Over 79 per cent of this capacity growth occurred in Asia. China is still the fastest expanding nuclear power producer of the world, the reports on nuclear power reactors and operating experience show.China currently has 56 nuclear power reactors in operation and a further 27 reactors currently under construction.\\\\xa0Background----------The annual \\\\xa0 underscores the IAEA\\\\\\'s long-standing commitment as the custodian of the only officially collected and maintained data relating to nuclear power operating experience.

Small modular reactors (SMRs) — a cheaper, quicker-to-deploy alternative to the large nuclear power plants (LNPPs) that have traditionally dominated the sector — potentially offer a form of fossil fuel–free electricity that could help the world reach its emissions targets. However, a wide range of SMR designs exist or are in development — 68 are listed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) — and the lack of a dominant, proven model could curb commitments from utilities and investors.**Most SMR designs are being developed in the US, Russia, and China, but the sector is attracting companies from a large number of countries, even those with limited or no nuclear experience, such as Argentina and Poland. In a major signal of progress, Rolls-Royce was named in June 2025 as the preferred bidder by Great British Energy - Nuclear to build the UK’s first SMRs — a milestone that brings the promise of this technology closer to reality and underscores growing confidence in its commercial viability.An even wider range of nations is thinking about adopting SMR designs developed by other countries, with over 30 considering, planning, or starting new nuclear power programs, amid projections that meeting 2050 net zero targets may require up to 800 GW of new nuclear capacity — more than double what has been built over the last six decades.The designs gaining the most traction — along with the costs, regulatory conditions, and supply chains they will need to gain a solid foothold in the market — are summarized below and explored in full detail in the\\\\xa0.THE MAIN SMR DESIGNS--------------------SMRs are defined by the IAEA as having power capacity of up to 300 MWe, and broadly fall into two categories:1.  **Gen III/III+** — adaptations of existing LNPP designs that use light water as the coolant; they offer the market familiar, well-understood technology.\\\\xa0    2.  **Gen IV** — new designs that use different cooling sources, such as helium, molten salt, or molten metal (e.g., sodium and lead); these are untested technologies with limited to no operating experience.\\\\xa0    !!\\\\xa0SMR designs by typeThe coolants and fuels used in Gen IV reactors may enable them to operate at much higher temperatures than LNPPs without the need for significantly pressurized containment vessels. This would greatly improve safety — a key issue for nuclear power — and enable new industrial applications beyond low-emission power generation, including the production of green steel and ammonia.PROVING THE POTENTIAL OF SMRs-----------------------------A key advantage of SMRs is their modular, factory-based construction. Components are built using standardized processes, which cuts costs and deployment times compared with often bespoke LNPPs.However, to get SMRs into the market, the firms behind the technology need to prove that it is fit for purpose. While China and Russia have begun to produce power using SMRs, some promising projects elsewhere have faced setbacks. NuScale’s Idaho Falls project was cancelled in November 2023 due to growing concerns over cost overruns, construction delays, and a declining willingness among project stakeholders to bear the risks associated with FOAK development. This is because China and Russia have comparatively fewer regulatory hurdles, and Western utilities want to know that SMRs can work in jurisdictions with regulations and operating environments similar to their own before they commit.\\\\xa0We believe that only a handful of the currently active SMR designs will reach successful commercial deployment, but high uncertainty exists around which will prevail. What appears more certain is that whichever SMR manufacturer achieves the first successful deployment in the West will secure a significant competitive advantage.!!\\\\xa0Gen III+ design development!!\\\\xa0Gen IV design development  REACHING WIDESPREAD ADOPTION\\\\xa0-----------------------------Bringing an SMR to market will depend on more than just the manufacturer. An entire ecosystem of stakeholders, including energy companies, regulators, numerous firms along the supply chain, and investors will all be involved.The financial challenges companies face in rolling out SMRs means that governments must create strategies and legislation to help SMRs along the way. The Danish government’s work with the wind power sector provides a successful path — plans, tariffs, and R&D funding initiatives it put in place during the 1990s encouraged development of the industry, and wind power now produces 54% of Danish electricity, while the country boasts numerous world leaders in the sector.!!\\\\xa0Lessons for SMRs from comparable industriesThe costs SMRs will have to achieve to compete with other forms of baseload power will vary by country, with analysis showing the average cost of producing electricity over their lifetime needs to be between €52 €/MWh in Sweden and €119 €/MWh in Greece.For this to be attainable, SMRs and their components must be compatible with large-scale production to reach economies of scale. In terms of supply chains, SMR designs based on light water technology and that operate in a similar way to conventional reactors may have an advantage over Gen IV designs, as an extensive LNPP international supply chain already exists.However, while LNPPs are normally tailored to specific customer needs and local regulations, SMRs will rely on common, standardized components manufactured centrally and shipped to the construction site. This is a completely new concept in the nuclear industry that poses challenges for all SMRs. Its viability needs to be proven to win investor support.!!The price SMR must achieve to be competitive  TURNING PROMISE INTO PROGRESS-----------------------------The SMR market faces a classic “chicken and egg” dilemma. Many elements within the supply chain will not develop until long-term demand becomes clearer, yet SMR technology will not be deployed unless the supply chain supporting it is in place. Success requires everything to fall into place simultaneously.\\\\xa0A recent surge of investments has expanded the global SMR project pipeline by 65% since 2021, pointing to SMRs’ potential as an attractive value proposition. The industry and its ecosystem are clearly at a tipping point, with major progress toward commercialization. However, with no Western SMR near completion, the promise of this new nuclear technology still has a long way to go to become reality.!!Achieving this will require a coordinated push by the entire nuclear ecosystem, led and encouraged by governments through financial subsidies, supportive environments, and harmonized international guidelines. Only in this way will dominant SMR designs emerge, de-risking investments and enabling an industry that can safely deliver green power globally.\\\\xa0Download and read Arthur D.

An entire ecosystem of stakeholders, including energy companies, regulators, numerous firms along the supply chain, and investors will all be involved.The financial challenges companies face in rolling out SMRs means that governments must create strategies and legislation to help SMRs along the way. The Danish government’s work with the wind power sector provides a successful path — plans, tariffs, and R&D funding initiatives it put in place during the 1990s encouraged development of the industry, and wind power now produces 54% of Danish electricity, while the country boasts numerous world leaders in the sector.!!\\\\xa0Lessons for SMRs from comparable industriesThe costs SMRs will have to achieve to compete with other forms of baseload power will vary by country, with analysis showing the average cost of producing electricity over their lifetime needs to be between €52 €/MWh in Sweden and €119 €/MWh in Greece.For this to be attainable, SMRs and their components must be compatible with large-scale production to reach economies of scale. In terms of supply chains, SMR designs based on light water technology and that operate in a similar way to conventional reactors may have an advantage over Gen IV designs, as an extensive LNPP international supply chain already exists.However, while LNPPs are normally tailored to specific customer needs and local regulations, SMRs will rely on common, standardized components manufactured centrally and shipped to the construction site. This is a completely new concept in the nuclear industry that poses challenges for all SMRs. Its viability needs to be proven to win investor support.!!The price SMR must achieve to be competitive  TURNING PROMISE INTO PROGRESS-----------------------------The SMR market faces a classic “chicken and egg” dilemma. Many elements within the supply chain will not develop until long-term demand becomes clearer, yet SMR technology will not be deployed unless the supply chain supporting it is in place. Success requires everything to fall into place simultaneously.\\\\xa0A recent surge of investments has expanded the global SMR project pipeline by 65% since 2021, pointing to SMRs’ potential as an attractive value proposition. The industry and its ecosystem are clearly at a tipping point, with major progress toward commercialization. However, with no Western SMR near completion, the promise of this new nuclear technology still has a long way to go to become reality.!!Achieving this will require a coordinated push by the entire nuclear ecosystem, led and encouraged by governments through financial subsidies, supportive environments, and harmonized international guidelines. Only in this way will dominant SMR designs emerge, de-risking investments and enabling an industry that can safely deliver green power globally.\\\\xa0Download and read Arthur D.

The outlook for the industry is being transformed by climate change policies, shifting energy priorities and technological advances. But delivery of a new generation of nuclear facilities could be compromised unless lessons are learned from past projects and the nuclear sector’s endemic cost and schedule overruns.The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts 2025 will mark an all-time high for nuclear power generation as output increases in France, Japanese plants start up again after the pause following the 2011 Fukushima disaster, and commercial reactors begin operations in many markets, including Europe, China, India, and Korea.[1] the US too new output is coming online. The first new-builds in 30 years – Vogtle 3 and 4 in Georgia – have entered commercial service. The Palisades plant in Michigan is scheduled to come back online this year after a $2 billion upgrade following its closure in 2022.[2] US and other governments are supporting this nuclear comeback to meet increased electricity demand and climate goals. Although the new Trump administration has already made moves to drop other low-carbon policy initiatives and funding, nuclear plant licences have been extended, and nuclear projects usually command bipartisan support.[3] (and in some American states), climate policies will drive nuclear expansion. Nuclear energy must make a growing contribution – alongside renewables – if the world is to decarbonize electricity generation. In December 2023, more than 20 countries from four continents at the COP28 climate action summit in Dubai signed a declaration to triple nuclear capacity to achieve global net zero by 2050.[4] European Union has given nuclear power the ‘green’ light for funding to promote sustainability.[5] transition to clean energy is also enabling China – which plans to double its nuclear capacity by 2030 – to reduce air pollution from coal-powered plants in major cities. Other Asian countries face similar challenges.As coal is phased out, wind and solar power have become a bigger source of energy, but renewable energy is intermittent in the absence of large-scale battery storage. Nuclear can provide a reliable baseload supply. Having nuclear in the mix can also protect a nation’s energy security. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine highlighted Europe’s dependence on imported fossil fuels.Meanwhile, the electrification of transport and other industries, and the expansion of data centres running power-hungry AI is stoking demand. In 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that electricity consumption by data centres, AI and the cryptocurrency sector could double by 2026. Electrification needs to accelerate rapidly on the IEA’s pathway for net zero by 2050. Electricity’s share in final energy consumption, which was up from 18% in 2015 to 20% in 2023, would approach 30% in 2030.[6] Tech as well as some other industrial users and governments are willing to pay a premium for secure, low-carbon power. In the US, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have struck high-value purchase agreements with nuclear generators. The energy will be supplied by a mixture of currently operating and recommissioned plants and a new generation of small modular reactors (SMRs).[7] 20-year contract (with Constellation, America’s largest nuclear operator) will help restart a mothballed reactor at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania. The facility is expected to produce 835 megawatts of power to offset Microsoft’s data centre electricity needs.[8] and Google are also investing in start-ups developing SMRs,[9]\\\\xa0… Continue reading while Meta has released requests for proposals from providers of 1-4 gigawatts of nuclear generation capacity to power data centres needed for AI.### **SMRs – small, modular and repeatable?**With outputs up to 300 megawatts, SMRs promise a more flexible and affordable nuclear option for supplanting fossil fuel power stations. Conventional larger-scale nuclear reactors can be challenged by their upfront capital costs and construction timelines. Some are projecting that building SMRs could take less than half the construction time for large reactors.[10] Manufacturing modules in controlled factory settings may increase efficiency and assure quality. Modular designs also allow capacity to be increased incrementally, further reducing financing risk.Apart from American SMR-powered nuclear submarines, the first SMR units are already operating in China and Russia. As with solar and wind technology, China gained an advantage on the West in SMR nuclear technology, while Russia leads in SMR fuel production. The US government and companies have been investing in SMR technology to catch up.[11] countries – including Canada and the UK – are also backing SMR technology and its export potential.[12] Some years away from commercial scale, there are said to be more than 80 SMR designs using diverse technologies at different stages of development globally.[13] Demonstration projects later this decade could pave the way for a rollout of commercial SMR fleets beginning in the 2030s.[14] of SMRs believe that their smaller scale and simpler designs should allow standardization and cost-effective manufacturing and assembly. This product-based approach – modelled on ‘shipyard’ production – could improve cost and schedule performance.[15]### The case for caution in nuclear constructionOur global experience of major nuclear engineering and construction projects – and other sectors (including shipbuilding) – teaches caution.Early SMRs will be first-of-a-kind projects with the associated risks and uncertainties that entails. In 2023 the first planned SMR in the US was cancelled due to rising construction costs and an electricity price uncompetitive with wind and solar.[16] Costs and delays could arise as the industry adapts to new designs and processes. This may also apply to the new generation of ‘advanced nuclear reactors’ using futuristic technologies (that some SMRs may leverage), such as molten salt, high-temperature gas cooling and sodium cooling, and travelling wave designs.[17] shorter SMR construction schedules do not guarantee programme certainty. Building a downsized reactor is still a complex capital project. Units should be easier to deploy – on brownfield sites of retired coal-fired plants, for example, or off-grid to provide power or heat to industry. Every location has unique features that can challenge contractors, however., which analyses the incidence and causes of claims and disputes, confirms the comparatively poor record of nuclear projects. Over the seven-year timeframe to 2024, disputed costs averaged 62.8% of budgeted capital expenditure on 27 nuclear projects in seven countries. This was notably higher than for power stations fuelled by fossil fuels (74 projects in total, in 32 countries), which faced overruns of 40.7%.![]( extensions of time claimed by contractors were highest on European nuclear projects – averaging 74% of planned schedules, and three times longer than in the Middle East (the region with the longest overruns for all infrastructure and capital projects).[18]CRUX data for time extensions on US nuclear projects is not cited here as it includes claims for the additional costs of storing spent nuclear due to breach of contract over the federal\\\\xa0… Continue readingResultant distress may be higher, but most of the main causes of claims and disputes on nuclear projects are shared with other types of construction projects. Change in scope, the primary and near-universal driver of conflict in construction, was nearly twice as likely to affect nuclear projects (34.5%) as fossil power stations.Another, related cause was late design information (24.1%). Immature designs not only make conflicts and delays during construction more likely, they also make it difficult to verify cost estimates and schedules. Optimism bias is by no means unique to the nuclear sector, but unrealistic budgets and schedules and the significant overruns that result can derail projects.[19]National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2023. Laying the Foundation for New and Advanced Nuclear Reactors in the United States.  ### Learning the lessons of past failuresCosts have ballooned on EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) contracts for nuclear plant projects around the world. This has often arisen from the civil (non-nuclear) construction element, according to a 2023 US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report on new nuclear construction.[20]National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2023. Laying the Foundation for New and Advanced Nuclear Reactors in the United States. Global in scope, the report also noted that past studies had cited ‘negative learning for nuclear.’It is no surprise that most recurrent causes of conflict across the CRUX database of 2,000 projects are also prominent in the nuclear sector. Poor management of subcontractors and their interfaces affected almost one in four nuclear projects (24.1%); and clashes over contract interpretation even more (27.6%).Alleged bias or failure to cooperate was far more common in nuclear (17.2%) than fossil power (2.9%) projects, perhaps reflecting a greater cultural diversity of project partners, if not sheer complexity.Part of that complexity arises from the regulatory requirements around nuclear safety. CRUX indicates that nuclear projects were more likely to be affected by late approvals than fossil fuel power stations (20.7% vs. 8.8%) or all non-nuclear power projects(16.5%). Such delays may be due to the procedures of either/both employers and regulators. Inadequate responses to information requests were also notably more common in the nuclear sector than in the power sector as a whole (20.7% vs. 8.1%). However, poor interface management with third parties was blamed for disputes on a slightly smaller proportion of nuclear than non-nuclear power projects (10.3% vs. 13.2%).Some argue skills shortages are to be expected in an industry that has been stagnant for many years. The IEA identified investment in human capital as a priority for countries committing to nuclear growth. Utilities have generally not retained the staff needed to execute large nuclear projects. Many megaproject owners rely on outsourced technical expertise, and lack the capacity to oversee projects (which is not unique to the nuclear industry).[21]National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2023. Laying the Foundation for New and Advanced Nuclear Reactors in the United States. Much of the global construction industry suffers from skills gaps and problems with workmanship. The US, for example, has a shortfall in mechanical and electrical engineering talent, as well as critical trades such as welding.![]( More proactive reactor constructionAs much as $1.5 trillion could be invested in the nuclear renaissance through to 2050,[22] but the scale and unpredictability of construction costs remain a major obstacle. Citing past cost and schedule overruns, an investment analysis of the European nuclear market calls for new frameworks to mitigate the construction risks and attract capital.[23] CRUX research and some of the other evidence explored here point to some essential guardrails for new-build nuclear projects.At the outset, challenge sessions and war gaming can help crystallize the risks and choices for investors, promoters and other stakeholders. Independent checks of cost estimates and schedules by industry experts can mitigate optimism bias. The earlier the design is completed on a project, the fewer associated delays are likely to be encountered, and the greater chance the project will be delivered on time and budget.A proactive approach by project employers and fairly balanced allocation of risks among the parties will improve risk management and foster more productive working relationships with EPC contractors. Intelligent use of BIM (building information modelling) can enhance coordination and construction management. The potential benefits over the life cycle of both the project and operations may justify the creation of digital twins. During construction, comprehensive risk registers and robust project controls remain essential to keep projects on track.Notwithstanding new funding models, most nuclear projects worldwide rely on some level of government support – not only financial, but also to address skills shortages and regulatory risk. In the US, for example, the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act recognised the need to fund the training of a new generation of nuclear engineers and fill gaps in other project-critical professions and trades.Meanwhile, project teams can tailor design processes to align with regulation so that approvals overlap with design progress to minimise hold-ups. The ability to replicate proven SMRs should ease this regulatory burden. International efforts to streamline and harmonise design certification are also encouraging.[24] the project level, a proactive approach to engineering and construction will be needed to mitigate risk and avoid past pitfalls, enabling cost-effective delivery of the nuclear renaissance.### About the authorKim Reome is a specialist in damages analysis in the construction and electric utility industries with over 30 years’ experience.

(Photo: D. Calma/IAEA)There is growing global interest in nuclear energy, and countries are acting on this interest. In the opening session of the Scientific Forum, the President of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo, shared his plans for the inclusion of nuclear energy in the country’s electricity generation mix. “We’re committed to a clean, equitable energy transition that harnesses the full potential of all low carbon sources, including nuclear power,” President Akufo-Addo said. “Nuclear power will play a significant part in this transformation.”\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Ghana is analysing small modular reactors (SMRs) and their potential for rapid deployment for clean and affordable energy. “We are working with industry experts to study the feasibility of deploying this new technology in Ghana,” President Akufo-Addo said.\\\\xa0In the United States of America, where nuclear power provides the single largest source of clean energy, “reaching our 2050 net zero goals depends on at least tripling our nuclear energy capacity to 300 gigawatts or more,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm. The US Government has invested “billions of dollars in the future of nuclear energy, creating historic tax incentives for investments in new facilities and production of nuclear energy,” and the development of a domestic fuel supply chain is underway, she added\\\\xa0\\\\xa0The US Department of Energy recently released , a set of reports to accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies, including advanced nuclear reactors. Advanced reactors are key to reaching net zero goals because they can help to decarbonize energy intensive industries, such as hydrogen production, desalination, district heating, petroleum refining and fertilizer production, Secretary Granholm said. She encouraged more countries to look at nuclear energy as a sustainable, long term investment and to harness “the power of the atom for a new era of peace and prosperity in what is potentially the greatest peace project of our time – a net zero world.”\\\\xa0The Republic of Korea is also investing in growing its nuclear sector. Since 2000, Korea has been implementing its Nuclear Power System Development Plan, with a specific focus on developing advanced reactors, and as a result, in 2012, Korea’s first SMR – SMART – received the standard design approval from the Korean regulator, said Lee Jong-Ho, Minister of Science and ICT in the Republic of Korea. “Now we are developing an even more advanced and innovative SMR based on SMART technology,” he added.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0The Korean Government believes that the private sector should take the lead in technological innovations. “This is especially true for the SMR sector, which aims to replace fossil fuels in industries such as seawater desalination and space exploration,” Minister Jong-Ho said. The Korean Government is launching the Korea SMR Initiative to transfer SMART and other advanced nuclear technologies to the private sector in order to help demonstrate and commercialize new reactors. “To kick start these efforts, starting next year, the Government will collaborate with the relevant companies to invest in developing high temperature gas reactors designed for industrial process heat with applications such as hydrogen production and other uses,” he said.\\\\xa0In Morocco, the Government is considering adding nuclear power to its energy mix to ensure a reliable energy supply. “Morocco places a distinct focus on small modular reactors due to their numerous advantages, including the flexibility for integration,” said Leila Benali, Morocco’s Minister of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development, in a video statement to the Forum. “They hold significant promise for diverse applications, such as combined heat and power generation and seawater desalination.”\\\\xa0Minister Benali also announced that Morocco’s National Centre for Nuclear Energy, Sciences and Technology has been designated as an , enabling it to function as a global learning platform. “Morocco\\\\\\'s national infrastructure that is now reinforced by this recognition is open for the benefit of the African continent with a focus on capacity building,” she said.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0For the past 40 years, Sweden has expanded different forms of renewable energy, with wind power providing a significant share of electricity, and biomass replacing oil and coal for district heating and industrial processes. “What was forgotten, though, was that the power system is very sensitive and that it has to work technically. It\\\\\\'s not just about adding terawatt hours,” said Sweden’s Vice Minister for Climate and the Environment, Daniel Westlén. Considering the requirement for dispatchable energy to meet demand, when and where needed, as well as for demand to be met without carbon emissions, the options are limited. “Nuclear energy is the only option available,” he added.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0To reach climate and net zero goals, studies have estimated a doubling or tripling of nuclear energy capacity by 2050. “Can the world build 20 or even 40 gigawatts of nuclear energy per year? I would claim it is possible. We’ve done it before,” Vice Minister Westlén said. In the 1980s, more than 180 reactors were under construction globally, and more than 30 gigawatts were added in one single year, he explained. Sweden deployed 12 large reactors between 1972 and 1985.

By 2035, China expects to build 150 new nuclear reactors. “We have so many coal-fired power stations that must be replaced by nuclear power,” said Yu Jianfeng,\\\\u202fChairman of China National Nuclear Corporation, during the closing session of the Forum on Wednesday.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0In the United Kingdom, “we have an ambitious target of 24 gigawatts of nuclear power to be on the UK grid by 2050,” said Andrew Bowie, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and Minister for Nuclear and Networks. “As vital as it is to decarbonize our energy baseload, it is also about prices – the cost of living, affordable energy, and being energy secure and independent.”\\\\xa0\\\\xa0When it comes to prices, Finland’s Minister of Climate and Environment, Kai Mykkänen, told the Forum that Finland’s Olkiluoto 3, Europe’s largest nuclear reactor at 1.6 gigawatts, has led to the lowest electricity prices in Finland in years. Olkiluoto 3, which began regular output in April, is the key reason Finland has ceased direct electricity and natural gas imports, while simultaneously lowering electricity prices, he said.\\\\xa0Public acceptance, as well as financing, surrounding nuclear power must also be considered in the path forward. “We have to interact with society to ensure the technical solutions we propose will be, in the end, accepted,” said Peter Baeten, Director General of the Belgian Nuclear Research Center SCK CEN. Furthermore, while technical innovation is essential, there are other aspects of innovation, said Sama Bilbao,\\\\u202fDirector General of World Nuclear Association. “We need innovation in the way we finance new nuclear. We need to think outside the box to attract investment into these nuclear projects,” she added.\\\\xa0Given the speed and scale of innovation within the nuclear field, Director General Grossi is optimistic. “There are challenges, but it is clear – we are moving decisively. We are moving, perhaps, at different paces and in different ways,” he said. “The end result will not be uniform because there is not a one-size-fits-all solution. But we can see how nuclear is very firmly positioned in this global effort that is taking place now.”\\\\xa0\\\\xa0![]( closing session of the Scientific Forum at the IAEA 67th General Conference held at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, Austria, 27 September 2023.

(Photo: D. Calma/IAEA)There is growing global interest in nuclear energy, and countries are acting on this interest. In the opening session of the Scientific Forum, the President of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo, shared his plans for the inclusion of nuclear energy in the country’s electricity generation mix. “We’re committed to a clean, equitable energy transition that harnesses the full potential of all low carbon sources, including nuclear power,” President Akufo-Addo said. “Nuclear power will play a significant part in this transformation.”\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Ghana is analysing small modular reactors (SMRs) and their potential for rapid deployment for clean and affordable energy. “We are working with industry experts to study the feasibility of deploying this new technology in Ghana,” President Akufo-Addo said.\\\\xa0In the United States of America, where nuclear power provides the single largest source of clean energy, “reaching our 2050 net zero goals depends on at least tripling our nuclear energy capacity to 300 gigawatts or more,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm. The US Government has invested “billions of dollars in the future of nuclear energy, creating historic tax incentives for investments in new facilities and production of nuclear energy,” and the development of a domestic fuel supply chain is underway, she added\\\\xa0\\\\xa0The US Department of Energy recently released , a set of reports to accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies, including advanced nuclear reactors. Advanced reactors are key to reaching net zero goals because they can help to decarbonize energy intensive industries, such as hydrogen production, desalination, district heating, petroleum refining and fertilizer production, Secretary Granholm said. She encouraged more countries to look at nuclear energy as a sustainable, long term investment and to harness “the power of the atom for a new era of peace and prosperity in what is potentially the greatest peace project of our time – a net zero world.”\\\\xa0The Republic of Korea is also investing in growing its nuclear sector. Since 2000, Korea has been implementing its Nuclear Power System Development Plan, with a specific focus on developing advanced reactors, and as a result, in 2012, Korea’s first SMR – SMART – received the standard design approval from the Korean regulator, said Lee Jong-Ho, Minister of Science and ICT in the Republic of Korea. “Now we are developing an even more advanced and innovative SMR based on SMART technology,” he added.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0The Korean Government believes that the private sector should take the lead in technological innovations. “This is especially true for the SMR sector, which aims to replace fossil fuels in industries such as seawater desalination and space exploration,” Minister Jong-Ho said. The Korean Government is launching the Korea SMR Initiative to transfer SMART and other advanced nuclear technologies to the private sector in order to help demonstrate and commercialize new reactors. “To kick start these efforts, starting next year, the Government will collaborate with the relevant companies to invest in developing high temperature gas reactors designed for industrial process heat with applications such as hydrogen production and other uses,” he said.\\\\xa0In Morocco, the Government is considering adding nuclear power to its energy mix to ensure a reliable energy supply. “Morocco places a distinct focus on small modular reactors due to their numerous advantages, including the flexibility for integration,” said Leila Benali, Morocco’s Minister of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development, in a video statement to the Forum. “They hold significant promise for diverse applications, such as combined heat and power generation and seawater desalination.”\\\\xa0Minister Benali also announced that Morocco’s National Centre for Nuclear Energy, Sciences and Technology has been designated as an , enabling it to function as a global learning platform. “Morocco\\\\\\'s national infrastructure that is now reinforced by this recognition is open for the benefit of the African continent with a focus on capacity building,” she said.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0For the past 40 years, Sweden has expanded different forms of renewable energy, with wind power providing a significant share of electricity, and biomass replacing oil and coal for district heating and industrial processes. “What was forgotten, though, was that the power system is very sensitive and that it has to work technically. It\\\\\\'s not just about adding terawatt hours,” said Sweden’s Vice Minister for Climate and the Environment, Daniel Westlén. Considering the requirement for dispatchable energy to meet demand, when and where needed, as well as for demand to be met without carbon emissions, the options are limited. “Nuclear energy is the only option available,” he added.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0To reach climate and net zero goals, studies have estimated a doubling or tripling of nuclear energy capacity by 2050. “Can the world build 20 or even 40 gigawatts of nuclear energy per year? I would claim it is possible. We’ve done it before,” Vice Minister Westlén said. In the 1980s, more than 180 reactors were under construction globally, and more than 30 gigawatts were added in one single year, he explained. Sweden deployed 12 large reactors between 1972 and 1985. While “climate change is the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced… we are in possession of the tools that we will need to solve this,” he concluded.\\\\xa0Last year, French President Emmanuel Macron announced a programme to build six nuclear reactors, as well as a programme dedicated to nuclear and innovation with small and advanced modular reactors. “We need energy, which is at the same time cheap, affordable and sustainable. And that\\\\\\'s not so easy to solve,” said François Jacq, General Administrator of the French Atomic Energy Commission. “That\\\\\\'s why we need innovation.” Innovation will come in many forms – in applications, approaches and technologies – and will also attract the future generation to the nuclear field.\\\\xa0“We will also have to innovate in the field of cooperation, in partnership.

Initially, fusion research in the USA and USSR was linked to atomic weapons development, and it remained classified until the 1958 Atoms for Peace conference in Geneva. Following a breakthrough at the Soviet tokamak, fusion research became \\\\\\'big science\\\\\\' in the 1970s. But the cost and complexity of the devices involved increased to the point where international co-operation was the only way forward.\\\\xa0The Fusion Industry Association report \")\\\\xa0said that $2.83 billion of new investment was declared by private nuclear fusion companies since the 2021 edition of the report.Fusion powers the Sun and stars as hydrogen atoms fuse together to form helium, and matter is converted into energy. Hydrogen, heated to very high temperatures changes from a gas to a plasma in which the negatively-charged electrons are separated from the positively-charged atomic nuclei (ions). Normally, fusion is not possible because the strongly repulsive electrostatic forces between the positively charged nuclei prevent them from getting close enough together to collide and for fusion to occur. However, if the conditions are such that the nuclei can overcome the electrostatic forces to the extent that they can come within a very close range of each other, then the attractive nuclear force (which binds protons and neutrons together in atomic nuclei) between the nuclei will outweigh the repulsive (electrostatic) force, allowing the nuclei to fuse together. Such conditions can occur when the temperature increases, causing the ions to move faster and eventually reach speeds high enough to bring the ions close enough together. The nuclei can then fuse, causing a release of energy.Fusion technology-----------------In the Sun, massive gravitational forces create the right conditions for fusion, but on Earth they are much harder to achieve. Fusion fuel – different isotopes of hydrogen – must be heated to extreme temperatures of the order of 50 million degrees Celsius, and must be kept stable under intense pressure, hence dense enough and confined for long enough to allow the nuclei to fuse. The aim of the controlled fusion research program is to achieve \\\\\\'ignition\\\\\\', which occurs when enough fusion reactions take place for the process to become self-sustaining, with fresh fuel then being added to continue it.\\\\xa0Once ignition is achieved, there is net energy yield – about four times as much as with nuclear fission. According to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the amount of power produced increases with the square of the pressure, so doubling the pressure leads to a fourfold increase in energy production.With current technology, the reaction most readily feasible is between the nuclei of the two heavy forms (isotopes) of hydrogen – deuterium (D) and tritium (T). Each D-T fusion event releases 17.6 MeV (2.8 x 10-12 joule, compared with 200 MeV for a U-235 fission and 3-4 MeV for D-D fusion). On a mass basis, the D-T fusion reaction releases over four times as much energy as uranium fission. Deuterium occurs naturally in seawater (30 grams per cubic metre), which makes it very abundant relative to other energy resources. Tritium occurs naturally only in trace quantities (produced by cosmic rays) and is radioactive, with a half-life of around 12 years. Usable quantities can be made in a conventional nuclear reactor, or in the present context, bred in a fusion system from lithium. Lithium is found in large quantities (30 parts per million) in the Earth\\\\\\'s crust and in weaker concentrations in the sea.In a fusion reactor, the concept is that neutrons generated from the D-T fusion reaction will be absorbed in a blanket containing lithium which surrounds the core. The lithium is then transformed into tritium (which is used to fuel the reactor) and helium. The blanket must be thick enough (about 1 metre) to slow down the\\\\xa0high-energy (14 MeV) neutrons. The kinetic energy of the neutrons is absorbed by the blanket, causing it to heat up. The heat energy is collected by the coolant (water, helium or Li-Pb eutectic) flowing through the blanket and, in a fusion power plant, this energy will be used to generate electricity by conventional methods.\\\\xa0If insufficient tritium is produced, some supplementary source must be employed such as using a fission reactor to irradiate heavy water or lithium with neutrons, and extraneous tritium creates difficulties with handling, storage and transport.The difficulty has been to develop a device that can heat the D-T fuel to a high enough temperature and confine it long enough so that more energy is released through fusion reactions than is used to get the reaction going. While the D-T reaction is the main focus of attention, long-term hopes are for a D-D reaction, but this requires much higher temperatures.In any case, the challenge is to apply the heat to human needs, primarily generating electricity. The energy density of fusion reactions in gas is very much less than for fission reactions in solid fuel, and as noted the heat yield per reaction is 70 times less. Hence thermonuclear fusion will always have a much lower power density than nuclear fission, which means that any fusion reactor needs to be larger and therefore more costly, than a fission reactor of the same power output. In addition, nuclear fission reactors use solid fuel which is denser than a thermonuclear plasma, so the energy released is more concentrated.\\\\xa0Also the neutron energy from fusion is higher than from fission – 14.1 MeV instead of about 2 MeV, which presents significant challenges regarding structural materials.At present, two main experimental approaches are being studied: magnetic confinement and inertial confinement. The first method uses strong magnetic fields to contain the hot plasma. The second involves compressing a small pellet containing fusion fuel to extremely high densities using strong lasers or particle beams.\\\\xa0A range of magnetized target fusion systems are also being developed, along with experiments with hybrid fusion.### Magnetic confinementIn magnetic confinement fusion (MCF), hundreds of cubic metres of D-T plasma at a density of less than a milligram per cubic metre are confined by a magnetic field at a few atmospheres pressure and heated to fusion temperature.Magnetic fields are ideal for confining a plasma because the electrical charges on the separated ions and electrons mean that they follow the magnetic field lines. The aim is to prevent the particles from coming into contact with the reactor walls as this will dissipate their heat and slow them down. The most effective magnetic configuration is toroidal, shaped like a doughnut, in which the magnetic field is curved around to form a closed loop. For proper confinement, this toroidal field must have superimposed upon it a perpendicular field component (a poloidal field). The result is a magnetic field with force lines following spiral (helical) paths that confine and control the plasma.There are several types of toroidal confinement system, the most important being tokamaks, stellarators and reversed field pinch (RFP) devices.In a tokamak, the toroidal field is created by a series of coils evenly spaced around the torus-shaped reactor, and the poloidal field is created by a system of horizontal coils outside the toroidal magnet structure. A strong electric current is induced in the plasma using a central solenoid, and this induced current also contributes to the poloidal field. In a stellarator, the helical lines of force are produced by a series of coils which may themselves be helical in shape. Unlike tokamaks, stellarators do not require a toroidal current to be induced in the plasma. RFP devices have the same toroidal and poloidal components as a tokamak, but the current flowing through the plasma is much stronger and the direction of the toroidal field within the plasma is reversed.In tokamaks and RFP devices, the current flowing through the plasma also serves to heat it to a temperature of about 10 million degrees Celsius. Beyond that, additional heating systems are needed to achieve the temperatures necessary for fusion. In stellarators, these heating systems have to supply all the energy needed.The tokamak (_toroidalnya kamera ee magnetnaya katushka_ – torus-shaped magnetic chamber) was designed in 1951 by Soviet physicists Andrei Sakharov and Igor Tamm. Tokamaks operate within limited parameters outside which sudden losses of energy confinement (disruptions) can occur, causing major thermal and mechanical stresses to the structure and walls. Nevertheless, it is considered the most promising design, and research is continuing on various tokamaks around the world.Research is also being carried out on several types of stellarator. Lyman Spitzer devised and began work on the first fusion device – a stellarator – at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory in 1951. Due to the difficulty in confining plasmas, stellarators fell out of favour until computer modelling techniques allowed accurate geometries to be calculated. Because stellarators have no toroidal plasma current, plasma stability is increased compared with tokamaks. Since the burning plasma can be more easily controlled and monitored, stellerators have an intrinsic potential for steady-state, continuous operation. The disadvantage is that, due to their more complex shape, stellarators are much more complex than tokamaks to design and build.RFP devices differ from tokamaks mainly in the spatial distribution of the toroidal magnetic field, which changes sign at the edge of the plasma. The RFX machine in Padua, Italy is used to study the physical problems arising from the spontaneous reorganization of the magnetic field, which is an intrinsic feature of this configuration.### Inertial confinementIn inertial confinement fusion, which is a newer line of research, laser or ion beams are focused very precisely onto the surface of a target, which is a pellet of D-T fuel, a few millimetres in diameter. This heats the outer layer of the material, which explodes outwards generating an inward-moving compression front or implosion that compresses and heats the inner layers of material. The core of the fuel may be compressed to one thousand times its liquid density, resulting in conditions where fusion can occur. The energy released then would heat the surrounding fuel, which may also undergo fusion leading to a chain reaction (known as ignition) as the reaction spreads outwards through the fuel. The time required for these reactions to occur is limited by the inertia of the fuel (hence the name), but is less than a microsecond. So far, most inertial confinement work has involved lasers.Recent work at Osaka University\\\\\\'s Institute of Laser Engineering in Japan suggests that ignition may be achieved at lower temperature with a second very intense laser pulse guided through a millimetre-high gold cone into the compressed fuel, and timed to coincide with the peak compression. This technique, known as \\\\\\'fast ignition\\\\\\', means that fuel compression is separated from hot spot generation with ignition, making the process more practical.In the UK  based near Oxford is researching inertial fusion energy (IFE) with a focus on power driver technology using an asymmetric implosion approach. As well as power generation, the company envisages material processing and chemical manufacturing applications. In March 2025 the company announced that it would focus on providing its amplifier technology, dropping earlier plans to develop a power plant.The US  is a large laser-based inertial confinement fusion research device at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. It focuses 192 powerful laser beams into a small target in a few billionths of a second, delivering more than 2 MJ of ultraviolet energy and 500 TW of peak power.A completely different concept, the \\\\\\'Z-pinch\\\\\\' (or \\\\\\'zeta pinch\\\\\\'), uses a strong electrical current in a plasma to generate X-rays, which compress a tiny D-T fuel cylinder.### Magnetized target fusionMagnetized target fusion (MTF), also referred to as magneto-inertial fusion (MIF), is a pulsed approach to fusion that combines the compressional heating of inertial confinement fusion with the magnetically reduced thermal transport and magnetically enhanced alpha heating of magnetic confinement fusion.A range of MTF systems are currently being experimented with, and commonly use a magnetic field to confine a plasma with compressional heating provided by laser, electromagnetic or mechanical liner implosion. As a result of this combined approach, shorter plasma confinement times are required than for magnetic confinement (from 100 ns to 1 ms, depending on the MIF approach), reducing the requirement to stabilize the plasma for long periods. Conversely, compression can be achieved over timescales longer than those typical for inertial confinement, making it possible to achieve compression through mechanical, magnetic, chemical, or relatively low-powered laser drivers.Several approaches are underway to examine MTF, including experiments at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratory, the University of Rochester, and private companies General Fusion and Helion Energy.R&D challenges for MTF include whether a suitable target plasma can be formed and heated to fusion conditions while avoiding contamination from the liner, as with magnetic confinement and inertial confinement. Due to the reduced demands on confinement time and compression velocities, MTF has been pursued as a lower-cost and simpler approach to investigating these challenges than conventional fusion projects.In the UK General Fusion\\\\\\'s  at the UK Atomic Energy Authority\\\\\\'s Culham Campus, near Oxford, received planning consent for construction in January 2022. The company aims to construct a fusion energy power plant by the early 2030s.### Hybrid fusionFusion can also be combined with fission in what is referred to as hybrid nuclear fusion where the blanket surrounding the core is a subcritical fission reactor. The fusion reaction acts as a source of neutrons for the surrounding blanket, where these neutrons are captured, resulting in fission reactions taking place. These fission reactions would also produce more neutrons, thereby assisting further fission reactions in the blanket.The concept of hybrid fusion can be compared with an accelerator-driven system (ADS), where an accelerator is the source of neutrons for the blanket assembly, rather than nuclear fusion reactions (see page on ). The blanket of a hybrid fusion system can therefore contain the same fuel as an ADS – for example, the abundant element thorium or the long-lived heavy isotopes present in used nuclear fuel (from a conventional reactor) could be used as fuel.The blanket containing fission fuel in a hybrid fusion system would not require the development of new materials capable of withstanding constant neutron bombardment, whereas such materials would be needed in the blanket of a \\\\\\'conventional\\\\\\' fusion system. A further advantage of a hybrid system is that the fusion part would not need to produce as many neutrons as a (non-hybrid) fusion reactor would in order to generate more power than is consumed – so a commercial-scale fusion reactor in a hybrid system does not need to be as large as a fusion-only reactor.Fusion research---------------A long-standing quip about fusion points out that, since the 1970s, commercial deployment of fusion power has always been about 40 years away. While there is some truth in this, many breakthroughs have been made, particularly in recent years, and there are a number of major projects under development that may bring research to the point where fusion power can be commercialized.Several **tokamaks** have been built, including the Joint European Torus (JET)\\\\xa0and the Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak (MAST)\\\\xa0in the UK and the tokamak fusion test reactor (TFTR) at Princeton in the USA. The ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) project currently under construction in Cadarache, France will be the largest tokamak when it operates in the 2020s. The Chinese Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR) is a tokamak which is reported to be larger than ITER, and due for completion in 2030.\\\\xa0Meanwhile it is running its Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST). In the UK, Tokamak Energy has commissioned and is further developing its ST40 tokamak.\\\\xa0In March 2022 the US Department of Energy announced up to $50 million of federal funding to support US scientists conducting experimental research in fusion energy science. $20 million of this would support tokamak facilities, while the other $30 million would support\\\\xa0research to improve fusion performance and increase the duration of burning plasma scenarios.Much research has also been carried out on **stellarators**. A large one of these, the Large Helical Device at Japan\\\\\\'s National Institute of Fusion Research, began operating in 1998. It is being used to study the best magnetic configuration for plasma confinement. At the Garching site of the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Germany, research carried out at the Wendelstein 7-AS between 1988 and 2002 is being progressed at the Wendelstein 7-X, which was built over 19 years at Max Planck Institute\\\\\\'s Greifswald site and started up at the end of 2015. Another stellarator, TJII, is in operation in Madrid, Spain. In the USA, at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, where the first stellarators were built in 1951, construction on the NCSX stellerator was abandoned in 2008 due to cost overruns and lack of funding.There have also been significant developments in research into **inertial fusion energy** (IFE). Construction of the\\\\xa0$7 billion National Ignition Facility (NIF) at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), funded by the National Nuclear Security Administration, was completed in March 2009. The Laser Mégajoule (LMJ) in France’s Bordeaux region started operation in October 2014. Both are designed to deliver, in a few billionths of a second, nearly two million joules of light energy to targets measuring a few millimeters in size. The main purpose of both NIF and LMJ is\\\\xa0for research to support both countries\\\\\\' respective\\\\xa0nuclear weapons programs.In September 2021 the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) opened the Fusion Technology Facility at the Advanced Manufacturing Park in Rotherham. It will house test rigs including the Combined Heating and Magnetic Research Apparatus (CHIMERA), which would be the only device capable of\\\\xa0simulating\\\\xa0conditions of a fusion power plant to test prototype components.### ITERIn 1985, the Soviet Union suggested building a next generation tokamak with Europe, Japan and the USA. Collaboration was established under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Between 1988 and 1990, the initial designs were drawn up for an International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER, which also means \\\\\\'a path\\\\\\' or \\\\\\'journey\\\\\\' in Latin) with the aim of proving that fusion could produce useful energy. The four parties agreed in 1992 to collaborate further on engineering design activities for ITER. Canada and Kazakhstan are also involved through Euratom and Russia, respectively.Six years later, the ITER Council approved the first comprehensive design of a fusion reactor based on well-established physics and technology with a price tag of $6 billion. Then the USA decided pull out of the project, forcing a 50% reduction in costs and a redesign. The result was the ITER Fusion Energy Advanced Tokomak (ITER-FEAT) – initially expected to cost $3 billion but still achieve the targets of a self-sustaining reaction and a net energy gain. The envisaged energy gain is unlikely to be enough for a power plant, but it should demonstrate feasibility.In 2003, the USA rejoined the project and China also announced it would join. After deadlocked discussion, the six partners agreed in mid-2005 to site ITER at Cadarache, in southern France. The deal involved major concessions to Japan, which had put forward Rokkasho as a preferred site. The European Union (EU) and France would contribute half of the then estimated €12.8 billion total cost, with the other partners – Japan, China, South Korea, USA and Russia – putting in 10% each. Japan will provide a lot of the high-tech components, will host a €1 billion materials testing facility – the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF) – and will have the right to host a subsequent demonstration fusion reactor. India became the seventh member of the ITER consortium at the end of 2005. In November 2006, the seven members – China, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea, the USA and the European Union – signed the ITER implementing agreement.\\\\xa0The total cost of the 500 MW ITER comprises about half for the ten-year construction and half for 20 years of operation.Site preparation works at Cadarache commenced in January 2007. First concrete for the buildings was poured in December 2013. Experiments were due to begin in 2018, when hydrogen will be used to avoid activating the magnets, but this is now expected in 2035. The first D-T plasma is not expected until 2035.\\\\xa0ITER is large because confinement time increases with the cube of machine size. The vacuum vessel will be 19 m across and 11 m high, and weigh more than 5000 tonnes.The goal of ITER is to operate with a plasma thermal output of 500 MW (for at least 400 seconds continuously) with less than 50 MW of plasma heating power input. No electricity will be generated at ITER.An associated CEA facility at Cadarache is WEST, formerly Tore Supra, which is designed to test prototype components and accelerate their development for ITER. It is focused on the divertor structure to remove helium, testing the durability of tungsten materials used.A 2 GW Demonstration Power Plant, known as Demo, is expected to demonstrate large-scale production of electrical power on a continual basis. The conceptual design of Demo was expected to be completed by 2017, with construction beginning around 2024 and the first phase of operation commencing from 2033. It has since been delayed, with construction now planned for after 2040.In November 2022 it was announced that a defect had been discovered in the thermal shields and vacuum vessel of ITER. The bending and welding of cooling fluid in pipes to the thermal shield panels\\\\xa0resulted in stress corrosion cracking of up to 2.2mm deep in the pipes. Due to the risk of leaking, the installed module will\\\\xa0need to be lifted out and disassembled\\\\xa0in order to proceed with the repairs. ITER director general Pietro Barabaschi\\\\xa0said the consequences on schedule and cost \"will not be insignificant\". In March 2025 the manufacturing of the second vaccum vessel was completed.### JETIn 1978, the European Community (Euratom, along with Sweden and Switzerland) launched the Joint European Torus (JET) project in the UK. JET is the largest tokamak operating in the world today. A similar tokamak, JT-60, operates at the Naka Fusion Institute of Japan Atomic Energy Agency in Japan, but only JET has the facilities to use D-T fuel.Following a legal dispute with Euratom, in December 1999 JET\\\\\\'s international contract ended and the UKAEA\\\\xa0took over the management of JET on behalf of its European partners. From that time JET\\\\\\'s experimental programme has been co-ordinated by the European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA) parties.\\\\xa0JET is operated by the UKAEA\\\\\\'s Culham Centre for Fusion Research, a member of the EUROfusion consortium.JET produced its first plasma in 1983, and became the first experiment to produce controlled fusion power in November 1991, albeit with high input of electricity. Up to 16 MW of fusion power for one second and 5 MW sustained has been achieved in D-T plasmas using the device, from 24 MW of power injected into its heating system, and many experiments are conducted to study different heating schemes and other techniques. JET has been very successful in operating remote handling techniques in a radioactive environment to modify the interior of the device and has shown that the remote handling maintenance of fusion devices is realistic.JET is a key device in preparations for ITER. It has been significantly upgraded in recent years to test ITER plasma physics and engineering systems. Further enhancements are planned at JET with a view to exceeding its fusion power record in future D-T experiments. A compact device – Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak (MAST) – was developed alongside JET at Culham, partly to serve the ITER project, and the substantial\\\\xa0MAST Upgrade\\\\xa0project is now being implemented in stages to increase neutral beam power from 5 to 12.5 MW and the energy deposited in plasma from 2.5 to 30 MJ. MAST Upgrade is focused on designing a plasma exhaust system or divertor that would be able withstand the intense power loads created in commercial-sized fusion reactors. It achieved first plasma in October 2020.In 2019 the UK government committed £22 million over four years for the conceptual design of the Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP) at Culham. The technical objectives of STEP are: to deliver predictable net electricity greater than 100 MW; to exploit fusion energy beyond electricity production; to ensure tritium self-sufficiency; to qualify materials and components under appropriate fusion conditions of neutron flux; and to develop a viable path to affordable life-cycle costs. STEP is scheduled for completion in 2040.\\\\xa0In February 2022 researchers at JET achieved 59 megajoules of heat energy from fusion over a five-second period, doubling previous records.### Tokamak EnergyTokamak Energy in the UK is a private company developing a spherical tokamak, and hopes to commercialize this by 2030. The company grew out of Culham laboratory, home to JET, and its technology revolves around high temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets, which allow for relatively low-power and small-size devices, but high performance and potentially widespread commercial deployment. Its first tokamak with exclusively HTS magnets\\\\xa0– the ST25 HTS, Tokamak Energy\\\\\\'s second reactor\\\\xa0– demonstrated 29 hours\\\\\\' continuous plasma during the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition in London in 2015, a world record.The next reactor is the ST40 at Milton Park in Oxfordshire, which achieved first plasma in April 2017. It produced plasma temperatures of 15 million degrees Celsius in 2018 and 2019 after the commissioning of further magnetic coils. Chief executive of Tokamak Energy David Kingham said: \"The ST40 is designed to achieve 100 million degrees C and get within a factor of ten of energy break-even conditions.” The company is working with Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory on spherical tokamaks, and with the Plasma Science and Fusion Centre at MIT on HTS magnets.\\\\xa0In July 2020 it was awarded £10 million from the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), as part of the government’s Advanced Modular Reactor project. The funds will contribute to core development work on high temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets and plasma exhaust system (divertor) technologies. The divertor must handle high levels of heat and particle bombardment while removing impurities and waste from the system. It aims to have a prototype delivering electricity to the grid by 2030.### KSTARThe KSTAR (Korean Superconducting Tokamak Reactor) at the National Fusion Research Institute (NFRI) in Daejeon produced its first plasma in mid-2008. It is a pilot device for ITER, and involves much international collaboration. It will be a satellite of ITER during ITER’s operational phase. The tokamak with 1.8 metre major radius is the first to use Nb3Sn superconducting magnets, the same material to be used in the ITER project. Its first stage of development to 2012 was to prove baseline operation technologies and achieved plasma pulses of up to 20 seconds. For the second phase of development (2013-2017), KSTAR was upgraded to study long pulses of up to 300 seconds in H mode – the 100s target was in 2015 – and embark upon high-performance AT mode. It achieved 70 seconds in high-performance plasma operation in late 2016, a world record. In addition, KSTAR researchers also succeeded in achieving an alternative advanced plasma operation mode with the internal transport barrier (ITB). This is a steep pressure gradient in the core of the plasmas due to the enhanced core plasma confinement. NFRI said this is the first ITB operation achieved in the superconducting device at the lowest heating power. KSTAR Phase 3 (2018-2023) is to develop high performance, high efficiency AT mode technologies with long-pulse operation. Phase 4 (2023-2025) will test DEMO-related prior arts. The device does not have tritium handling capabilities, so will not use D-T fuel.### K-DEMO tokamakIn collaboration with the US Department of Energy\\\\\\'s Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) in New Jersey and South Korea’s National Fusion Research Institute (NFRI) K-DEMO is intended to be the next step toward commercial reactors from ITER, and would be the first plant to actually contribute power to an electric grid. According to the PPPL, it would generate \"some 1 billion watts of power for several weeks on end\", a much greater output than ITER\\\\\\'s goal of producing 500 million watts for 500 seconds by the late 2020s. K-DEMO is expected to have a 6.65m diameter major radius tokamak, and a test blanket module as part of the DEMO breeding blanket R&D. The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology plans to invest about KRW 1 trillion (US$ 941 million) in the project. About KRW 300 billion of that spending has already been funded. The government expects the project to employ nearly 2,400 people in the first phase, which will last throughout 2016. K-DEMO is expected to have an initial operational phase from about 2037 to 2050 to develop components for the second stage, which would produce electricity.### FAST (Fusion by Advanced Superconducting Tokamak)FAST aims to generate and sustain a plasma of deuterium-tritium (D-T) reactions, demonstrating an integrated fusion energy system that combines energy conversion including electricity generation and fuel technologies. To be sited in Japan, the project aims for power generation demonstration by the end of the 2030s. The aim is for power generation of 50 to 100 MW with 1000 seconds of D-T fusion burn, with the device planned to operate for a cumulative 1000 hours of full-power operation.EASTIn China the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) at China Academy of Sciences\\\\\\' Hefei Institutes of Physical Science (HFIPS) produced hydrogen plasma at 50 million degrees Celsius and held it for 102 seconds in 2017. In November 2018 it achieved 100 million degrees Celsius for 10 seconds, with input of 10 MW of electric power. In July 2020 EAST achieved a completely non-inductive, current-driven, steady-state plasma for over 100 seconds, claimed as a breakthrough with significant implications for the future China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR). In May 2021 it set a new world record of achieving a plasma temperature of 120 million degrees Celsius for 101 seconds. The experiment also realized a plasma temperature of 160 million degrees Celsius, lasting 20 seconds.TFTRIn the USA, the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) operated at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) from 1982 to 1997. In December 1993, TFTR became the first magnetic fusion device to perform extensive experiments with plasmas composed of D-T. The following year TFTR produced 10.7 MW of controlled fusion power – a record at that time. TFTR set other records, including the achievement of a plasma temperature of 510 million degrees centigrade in 1995. However, it did not achieve its goal of break-even fusion energy (where the energy input required is no greater than the amount of fusion energy produced), but achieved all of its hardware design goals, thus making substantial contributions to the development of ITER.ALCATORAt the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) since the 1970s a succession of small ALCATOR (Alto Campus Torus) high magnetic field torus reactors have operated on the principle of achieving high plasma pressure as the route to long plasma confinement. Alcator C-Mod is claimed to have the highest magnetic field and highest plasma pressure of any fusion reactor, and is the largest university-based fusion reactor in the world. It operated 1993-2016. In September 2016 it achieved a plasma pressure of 2.05 atmospheres at a temperature of 35 million degrees Celsius. The plasma produced 300 trillion fusion reactions per second and had a central magnetic field strength of 5.7 tesla. It carried 1.4 million amps of electrical current and was heated with over 4 MW of power. The reaction occurred in a volume of approximately 1 cubic metre and the plasma lasted for two seconds. Having achieved this record performance for a fusion reactor, government funding ceased.A scaled-up version planned to be built at Triotsk near Moscow in collaboration with the Kurchatov Institute is Ignitor, with 1.3 m diameter torus.### Large Helical Device\\\\xa0– stellaratorThe Large Helical Device (LHD) at Japan\\\\\\'s National Institute for Fusion Science in Toki, in the Gifu Prefecture, was the world\\\\\\'s largest stellarator. LHD produced its first plasma in 1998 and has demonstrated plasma confinement properties comparable to other large fusion devices. It has achieved an ion temperature of 13.5 keV (about 160 million degrees) and plasma stored energy of 1.44 million joules (MJ).### Wendelstein 7-X stellaratorFollowing a year of tests, this started up at the end of 2015, and helium plasma briefly reached about one million degrees centigrade.\\\\xa0In 2016 it progressed to using hydrogen, and using 2 MW it achieved plasma of 80 million degrees centigrade for a quarter of a second. W7-X is the world’s largest stellarator and it is planned to operate continuously for up to 30 minutes. It cost €1 billion ($1.1 billion).\\\\xa0\\\\xa0  Some good diagrams are in a\\\\xa0\\\\xa0on the Wendelstein 7-X.### Heliac-1 stellaratorAt the\\\\xa0Australian Plasma Fusion Research Facility\\\\xa0at the Australian National University the H-1 stellarator has run for some years and in 2014 was upgraded significantly. H-1 is capable of accessing a wide range of plasma configurations and allows exploration of ideas for improved magnetic design of the fusion power stations that will follow ITER.### National\\\\xa0Ignition\\\\xa0Facility\\\\xa0– laserThe world\\\\\\'s most powerful laser fusion facility, the $4 billion National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), was completed in March 2009. Using its 192 laser beams, NIF is able to deliver more than 60 times the energy of any previous laser system to its target. LLNL announced in July 2012 that in \"an historic record-breaking laser shot, the NIF laser system of 192 beams delivered more than 500 TW of peak power and 1.85 megajoules (MJ) of ultraviolet laser light to its (2mm diameter) target\" for a few trillionths of a second. In September 2013 for the first time the amount of energy released through the fusion reaction (14 kJ) exceeded the amount of energy being absorbed by the fuel, but not the amount supplied by the giant lasers (1.8 MJ). In August 2021 LLNL said that it had achieved a yield of 1.3 MJ, much better than its previous best of 55 kJ in 2018. It said this was \"a historic step forward for inertial confinment\" putting it \"at the threshold of fusion ignition.\"\\\\xa0In August 2021 NIF achieved a record fusion yield of 1.3 megajoules – 24 times greater than its previous best experiment – which LLNL said places it \"at the threshold of fusion ignition\".\\\\xa0A breakthrough in December 2022 resulted in an NIF experiment demonstrating the fundamental scientific basis for inertial confinement fusion energy for the first time. The experiment created fusion ignition when using 192 laser beams to deliver more than 2 MJ of ultraviolet energy to a deuterium-tritium fuel pellet.An earlier high-power laser at LLNL, Nova, was built in 1984 for the purpose of achieving ignition. Nova failed to do this and was closed in 1999, but provided essential data that led to the design of NIF. Nova also generated considerable amounts of data on high-density matter physics, which is useful both in fusion power and nuclear weapons research.In connection with NIF, LLNL is developing the Laser Inertial Fusion Engine (LIFE), a hybrid fusion system where neutrons resulting from laser fusion would drive a subcritical nuclear fission blanket to generate electricity. The blanket would contain either depleted uranium; used nuclear fuel; natural uranium or thorium; or plutonium-239, minor actinides and fission products from reprocessed used nuclear fuel.### Laser MégajouleMeanwhile, the French Atomic Energy Commission (Commissariat à l\\\\\\'énergie atomique, CEA) has operated a similar size laser – the Laser Mégajoule (LMJ) – near Bordeaux since 2014. Its 240 laser beams are able to generate 1.8 MJ pulses for a few billionths of a second, concentrated on a small deuterium and tritium target. A prototype laser, the Ligne d\\\\\\'Integration Laser (LIL), commenced operation in 2003.### SG-IIChina’s National Laboratory of High-Power Laser and Physics, associated with the China Academy of Science, has a laser inertial confinement experiment in Shanghai – the Shenguang-II eight-beam laser facility (SG-II), similar to the National Ignition Facility in the USA and Laser Mégajoule in France. It is the only high power neodymium-glass solid laser facility with an active probe light in China.\\\\u202fIn 2005 a ninth beam was added, advancing the capacity for fusion research. The SG-II facility is China’s high-power laser technology international demonstration base.### PETAL and HiPER lasersThe Petawatt Aquitaine Laser (PETAL) laser facility is a high energy multi-petawatt laser (3.5 kJ energy with a duration of 0.5 to 5 ps) under construction near Bordeaux, on the same site as LIL. PETAL will be coupled with LIL to demonstrate the physics and laser technology of fast ignition.The High Power Laser Energy Research Facility (HiPER) is being designed to build on the research planned at the PETAL project. HiPER will use a long pulse laser (currently estimated at 200kJ) combined with a 70kJ short pulse laser. A three-year preparatory phase that commenced in 2008 has direct funding or in-kind commitments amounting to around €70 million from several countries. The detailed engineering phase is projected to begin in 2011, with a six-year construction phase possibly commencing by 2014.### Z machineOperated by Sandia National Laboratories, the Z machine is the largest X-ray generator in the world. As with NIF, the facility was built as part of the country\\\\\\'s Stockpile Stewardship Program, which aims to maintain the stockpile of nuclear weapons without the need for full-scale testing.Conditions for fusion are achieved by passing a powerful electrical pulse (lasting less than 100 nanoseconds) through a set of fine tungsten wires inside a metal hohlraum. The wires turn into a plasma and experience a compression (\\\\\\'Z-pinch\\\\\\'), forcing the vapourized particles to collide with each other, thereby producing intense X-ray radiation. A tiny cylinder containing fusion fuel placed inside the hohlraum would therefore be compressed by the X-rays, allowing fusion to occur.In 2006, Z machine had achieved temperatures of over 2 billion degrees, considerably higher than what is needed for fusion, and in theory high enough to allow nuclear fusion of hydrogen with heavier elements such as lithium or boron.### Other fusion projectsThere is a considerable amount of research into many other fusion projects at various stages of development.**Lockheed CFR**. Lockheed Martin at its so-called ‘skunk works’ is developing a  (CFR) which uses conventional D-T plasma in evacuated containment but confines it differently. Instead of constraining the plasma within tubular rings, a series of superconducting coils will generate a new magnetic-field geometry in which the plasma is held within the broader confines of the entire reaction chamber. The energy is supplied by radiofrequency heating. Superconducting magnets within the coils will generate a magnetic field around the outer border of the chamber. The aim is to go to plasma pressure being as great as confining pressure at high enough temperature for ignition and net energy yield. Heat exchangers in the reactor wall would convey energy to a gas turbine. It has progressed to a magentized ion confinement experiment, but has some way to go before any prototype, which they claim will be very much smaller than conventional designs such as the ITER tokamak.Italy\\\\\\'s National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA) is developing a small tokamak reactor by the name of **Ignitor**. Under an Italian-Russian agreement signed in May 2010, a reactor will be assembled in Italy and installed at the Kurchatov Institute\\\\\\'s Troitsk Institute for Innovation and Fusion Research (TRINITI) near Moscow.An alternative to using powerful lasers for inertial confinement fusion is \\\\\\'**heavy ion fusion**\\\\\\', where high-energy particles from an accelerator are focused using magnetic fields onto the fusion target.\\\\xa0The  (Neutralized Drift Compression Experiment II) accelerator has been used for heavy ion fusion experiments since 2012 at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. It is being expanded to deliver short intense pulses of ion beams with kinetic energy of 1.2 MeV. High-energy-density physics (HEDP) experiments with laboratory plasmas is a growing part of inertial fusion energy (IFE) physics. (Lawrenceville Plasma Physics) is a US enterprise developing aneutronic fusion using a dense plasma focus device (DPF or **focus fusion**) and hydrogen-boron fuel. The hydrogen and boron (B-11) as plasma fuse at high temperature to form a pulsed beam of helium nuclei without emitting neutrons. (The boron and hydrogen combine to produce a brief intermediate carbon-12 atom which rapidly decays to three alpha particles.) This charged high-energy ion beam generates electricity as it passes through a series of coils similar to a transformer, at 80% efficiency. The balance of energy is as by-product X-rays which are captured in an array of photoelectric receptors. LPP Fusion has achieved electron energies of 400 keV.Another line of fusion research using lasers also involves fusing hydrogen and boron-11 to produce helium nuclei, which continue the chain reaction from boron. One laser generates a powerful magnetic confinement field in a coil to trap the fusion reaction in a small area for a nanosecond, while a second more powerful laser triggers the nuclear fusion process. Early H-11B fusion trials at the Prague Asterix Laser System, using high-energy iodine lasers, have generated more energy than needed to trigger the fusion process.\\\\xa0in Australia develops this and is aiming to use non-thermal laser technology to fuse hydrogen and boron-11. A nanosecond laser pulse ignites a H-B fusion reaction, then a second laser and capacitive coil produce a kilotesla magnetic field to increase the reaction yield. This step is now the focus of research. The yield is increased further by a chain reaction to create helium nuclei which are captured in a charged sphere of at least two metres diameter to produce electricity directly, without any steam circuit. The 2.9 MeV alpha particles represent up to 300 kWh of energy per 15 mg H-11B fuel. A new project is developing fuel materials by synthesizing boron-11-enriched hydrogen borides and hydrogen-adsorbed boron nitride nanosheets. These will be tested at laser facilities overseas.The **Polywell** (\\\\\\'polyhedron\\\\\\' combined with \\\\\\'potential well\\\\\\')\\\\xa0device\\\\xa0consists of magnetic coils arranged in a polyhedral configuration of six sides, forming a cube. A cloud of electrons is confined in the middle of the device so as to be able to accelerate and confine the positive ions to be fused. This electrostatic confinement concept differs from traditional magnetic confinement because the fields do not need to confine ions\\\\xa0– only electrons.  has been researching the Polywell concept and looking at hydrogen and boron as fuel for aneutronic fusion. This followed some years of development by the US Navy, using deuterium fuel.**** is one of a number of private efforts to develop a commercial fusion power plant. The company’s magnetized target fusion (MTF) approach generates a compact toroid plasma in an injector, containing and compressing it using a magnetic field before injecting it into a spherical compression chamber. The chamber holds a liquid lead-lithium liner which is pumped to create a vortex, into which the plasma target is injected. A synchronized array of pistons firing simultaneously creates a spherical compression wave in the liquid metal, compressing the plasma target and heating it to fusion conditions. Founded in Canada in 2002, General Fusion is funded by a syndicate of private investors, energy venture capital companies, sovereign wealth funds and the Canadian government’s Sustainable Development Technology Canada (SDTC) fund. A further government grant was announced in October 2018, from the Strategic Innovation Fund. The company has demonstrated milestones including creating 200-300 eV magnetized spheromak plasmas and confining them for over 500 µs.Much of current work underway on MTF is derived from programmes at the Soviet Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy, under E. P. Velikhov, circa 1970. This inspired the LINUS project at the Naval Research Laboratory in the USA, and later the fast-liner project at Los Alamos.General Atomics has operated the  tokamak in San Diego for the US Department of Energy since the late 1980s. It aims to establish the scientific basis for optimizing the tokamak approach to fusion energy production.### Cold fusionIn March 1989, spectacular claims were made for another approach, when two researchers, in the USA (Stanley Pons) and the UK (Martin Fleischmann), claimed to have achieved fusion in a simple tabletop apparatus working at room temperature. \\\\\\'N-Fusion\\\\\\', or \\\\\\'cold fusion\\\\\\', involves the electrolysis of heavy water using palladium electrodes on which deuterium nuclei are said to concentrate at very high densities. The researchers claimed that heat – which could only be explained in terms of nuclear processes – was produced, as well as fusion byproducts, including helium, tritium and neutrons. Other experimenters failed to replicate this, however, and most of the scientific community no longer considers it a real phenomenon.### Low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR)Initiated by claims for ‘cold fusion’, research at the nanotechnology level is continuing on low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR) which apparently use weak nuclear interactions (rather than strong force as in nuclear fission or fusion) to create low-energy neutrons, followed by neutron capture processes resulting in isotopic change or transmutation, without the emission of strong prompt radiation. LENR experiments involve hydrogen or deuterium permeation through a catalytic layer and reaction with a metal. Researchers report that energy is released, though on any reproducible basis, very little more than is input. The main practical example is hydrogen plus nickel powder evidently giving more heat than can be explained on any chemical basis.The Japanese government is sponsoring LENR research\\\\xa0– notably a nano-metal hydrogen energy project (MHE)\\\\xa0– through its New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), and Mitsubishi is also active in research.\\\\xa0Over 2015-2019 Google funded 30 researchers on three projects and found no evidence that LENR is possible, but they made some advances in measurement and materials science techniques. There was some indication that the two projects involving palladium merited further study.Assessing fusion power----------------------The use of fusion power plants could substantially reduce the environmental impacts of increasing world electricity demands since, like nuclear fission power, they would not contribute to acid rain or the greenhouse effect. Fusion power could easily satisfy the energy needs associated with continued economic growth, given the ready availability of fuels. There would be no danger of a runaway fusion reaction as this is intrinsically impossible and any malfunction would result in a rapid shutdown of the plant.However, although fusion does not generate long-lived radioactive products and the unburned gases can be treated on site, there would a short- to medium-term radioactive waste problem due to activation of the structural materials. Some component materials will become radioactive during the lifetime of a reactor, due to bombardment with high-energy neutrons, and will eventually become radioactive waste. The volume of such waste would be similar to the corresponding volumes from fission reactors. However, the long-term radiotoxicity of the fusion wastes would be considerably lower than that from actinides in used fission fuel, and the activation product wastes would be handled in much the same way as those from fission reactors with some years of operation..There are also other concerns, principally regarding the possible release of tritium into the environment. It is radioactive and very difficult to contain since it can penetrate concrete, rubber and some grades of steel. As an isotope of hydrogen, it is easily incorporated into water, making the water itself weakly radioactive. With a half-life of about 12.3 years, the presence of tritium remains a threat to health for about 125 years after it is created, as a gas or in water, if at high levels. It can be inhaled, absorbed through the skin or ingested. Inhaled tritium spreads throughout the soft tissues and tritiated water mixes quickly with all the water in the body. Although there is only a small inventory of tritium in a fusion reactor – a few grams – each could conceivably release significant quantities of tritium during operation through routine leaks, assuming the best containment systems. An accident could release even more. This is one reason why long-term hopes are for the deuterium-deuterium fusion process, dispensing with tritium.While fusion power clearly has much to offer when the technology is eventually developed, the problems associated with it also need to be addressed if it is to become a widely used future energy source.* * *Notes & References------------------### Notesa. The nucleus of deuterium (D) consists of one proton and one neutron, whereas hydrogen only has one proton. Tritium (T) has one proton and two neutrons. When the nuclei of D and T fuse, helium-4 (two protons and two neutrons) is formed, along with a free neutron. The 17.6 MeV of energy released in the fusion reaction takes the form of kinetic energy, the helium having 3.5 MeV and the neutron 14.1 MeV. The products of the fusion reaction have a total mass that is slightly lower than the starting materials (D and T), this decrease in mass having been converted to energy according to E=mc2. ]b. Tritium can be produced by bombardment of lithium-6 with neutrons of any energy. When lithium-6 (three protons, three neutrons) absorbs a neutron it splits into helium (two protons, two neutrons) and tritium (one proton, two neutrons), along with the release of 4.8 MeV of energy. Tritium can also be produced from the more-abundant lithium-7 from high-energy neutrons. Hence, natural lithium can be used for tritium generation in a fusion reactor. According to the European Commission: \"A 1 GW (electric) fusion plant will need about 100 kg deuterium and 3 tons of natural lithium to operate for a whole year, generating about 7 billion kWh.\" ]c. The European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA) was established to provide a framework for magnetic confinement fusion research within the European Union and Switzerland. ]d. The Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory has a webpage on TFTR\\\\xa0]e. The first inertial confinement fusion experiments at NIF (see  will use the \\\\\\'indirect drive\\\\\\' method, which differs from the \\\\\\'direct drive\\\\\\' method described in the main text. In the indirect drive method, the lasers are focused on a gold cavity (known as a _hohlraum_) containing the fuel pellet. The lasers rapidly heat the inside surface of the hohlraum, generating X-rays that cause a blowoff of the capsule surface, in turn causing the fuel capsule to implode in the same way as if it had been hit with the lasers directly. It is hoped that NIF will be the first laser in which the energy released from the fusion fuel will exceed the laser energy used to produce the fusion reaction. ]f. Z machine was designed to supply X-ray pulses of 50 terawatts, but improvements allowed pulses of 290 terawatts.

(Image: A. Barber Huescar/IAEA)Newly released nuclear power data for 2023 collected by the IAEA, paint a picture of a clean energy technology at a crossroads amid the  to accelerate its deployment.Electricity production from nuclear power rose by 2.6 per cent last year compared to 2022, according to the operating data provided by IAEA Member States to the Power Reactor Information System (PRIS) — the IAEA’s comprehensive and publicly available database on nuclear power. Nuclear power continued to generate almost 10 percent of the world’s electricity and a quarter of all low carbon electricity last year, according to the data, which are featured in two newly released annual IAEA publications: Nuclear Power Reactors in the World () and Operating Experience with Nuclear Power Stations in Member States ().The USA remained the world’s top producer of nuclear electricity, followed by China and France. China continued to lead in newbuilds, beginning construction on five reactors. Newcomer Egypt started building its second reactor, according to the data, which showed the global fleet operating at nearly full strength with a median capacity factor of 88 per cent. While new grid connections were made at nuclear power plants in Belarus, China, Republic of Korea, Slovakia and the United States of America, reactors were shut down in Belgium, China and Germany.The 2023 data come against the backdrop of growing global ambitions for nuclear technology amid an aging reactor fleet. More than two-thirds of reactors are at least 30 years old. In December 2023, in the historic first Global Stocktake at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai, the 198 signatory countries to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change called for accelerating the deployment of low-emission energy technologies including nuclear power for deep and rapid decarbonization, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as industry. In addition, more than 20 countries at COP28 pledged to work towards tripling global nuclear power capacity to reach net zero by 2050.“IAEA data shows the global fleet of nuclear reactors continues to be a large and indispensable source of low-carbon electricity,” said IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi. “But it’s also clear that we will need to extend the lives of existing reactors, replace retiring facilities with new ones, and add a lot of new capacity so that global climate change and energy security goals can be reached.”]( Nuclear Power Development and Operating Experience Highlights------------------------------------------------------------------**Nuclear power status and trends**]( Taiwan, China - nuclear electricity produced:17.2 TWh, share of nuclear electricity produced: 6.9 per cent. Ukraine has not submitted 2023 data by the time of publication]( of the end of December 2023, global operational nuclear power capacity was 371.5 GW(e), provided by 413 reactors in 31 countries. However, only 403 reactors, with a combined capacity of 364.5 GW(e), reported their electricity production to the IAEA. Twenty-five reactors remained in suspended operations throughout the year, despite being licenced for operation. This includes four reactors in India with a combined net capacity of 639 MW(e) and 21 reactors in Japan with a combined net capacity of around 21 000 MW(e). Japan restarted two reactors in 2023, Takahama-1 and Takahama-2, which had been in suspended operation since 2011.Nuclear power capacity has remained at a consistent level over the past decade, with an additional 69.8 GW(e) nuclear capacity connected to the grid since the beginning of 2013. Over 79 per cent of this capacity growth occurred in Asia. China is still the fastest expanding nuclear power producer of the world, the reports on nuclear power reactors and operating experience show.China currently has 56 nuclear power reactors in operation and a further 27 reactors currently under construction.\\\\xa0Background----------The annual \\\\xa0 underscores the IAEA\\\\\\'s long-standing commitment as the custodian of the only officially collected and maintained data relating to nuclear power operating experience. As in previous years, the 55th edition of the report includes annual performance data, outage information, and statistical information on electricity production and the overall performance of individual nuclear power plants that were operational in 2023. is one of the IAEA’s most popular annual publications. It contains a summary of recent specification and performance data on nuclear reactors in IAEA Member States and technical data on reactors that are either planned, under construction, operational or that were shut down or decommissioned.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Both publications are entirely based on data submitted to IAEA by officially nominated national data providers and maintained in , the world’s only authoritative and most comprehensive database on nuclear power.Information and data received by the IAEA through 21 June 2024 are included in the 2023 highlights and in the OPEX and RDS-2 publications.

Small modular reactors (SMRs) — a cheaper, quicker-to-deploy alternative to the large nuclear power plants (LNPPs) that have traditionally dominated the sector — potentially offer a form of fossil fuel–free electricity that could help the world reach its emissions targets. However, a wide range of SMR designs exist or are in development — 68 are listed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) — and the lack of a dominant, proven model could curb commitments from utilities and investors.**Most SMR designs are being developed in the US, Russia, and China, but the sector is attracting companies from a large number of countries, even those with limited or no nuclear experience, such as Argentina and Poland. In a major signal of progress, Rolls-Royce was named in June 2025 as the preferred bidder by Great British Energy - Nuclear to build the UK’s first SMRs — a milestone that brings the promise of this technology closer to reality and underscores growing confidence in its commercial viability.An even wider range of nations is thinking about adopting SMR designs developed by other countries, with over 30 considering, planning, or starting new nuclear power programs, amid projections that meeting 2050 net zero targets may require up to 800 GW of new nuclear capacity — more than double what has been built over the last six decades.The designs gaining the most traction — along with the costs, regulatory conditions, and supply chains they will need to gain a solid foothold in the market — are summarized below and explored in full detail in the\\\\xa0.THE MAIN SMR DESIGNS--------------------SMRs are defined by the IAEA as having power capacity of up to 300 MWe, and broadly fall into two categories:1.  **Gen III/III+** — adaptations of existing LNPP designs that use light water as the coolant; they offer the market familiar, well-understood technology.\\\\xa0    2.  **Gen IV** — new designs that use different cooling sources, such as helium, molten salt, or molten metal (e.g., sodium and lead); these are untested technologies with limited to no operating experience.\\\\xa0    !!\\\\xa0SMR designs by typeThe coolants and fuels used in Gen IV reactors may enable them to operate at much higher temperatures than LNPPs without the need for significantly pressurized containment vessels. This would greatly improve safety — a key issue for nuclear power — and enable new industrial applications beyond low-emission power generation, including the production of green steel and ammonia.PROVING THE POTENTIAL OF SMRs-----------------------------A key advantage of SMRs is their modular, factory-based construction. Components are built using standardized processes, which cuts costs and deployment times compared with often bespoke LNPPs.However, to get SMRs into the market, the firms behind the technology need to prove that it is fit for purpose. While China and Russia have begun to produce power using SMRs, some promising projects elsewhere have faced setbacks. NuScale’s Idaho Falls project was cancelled in November 2023 due to growing concerns over cost overruns, construction delays, and a declining willingness among project stakeholders to bear the risks associated with FOAK development. This is because China and Russia have comparatively fewer regulatory hurdles, and Western utilities want to know that SMRs can work in jurisdictions with regulations and operating environments similar to their own before they commit.\\\\xa0We believe that only a handful of the currently active SMR designs will reach successful commercial deployment, but high uncertainty exists around which will prevail.

The Danish government’s work with the wind power sector provides a successful path — plans, tariffs, and R&D funding initiatives it put in place during the 1990s encouraged development of the industry, and wind power now produces 54% of Danish electricity, while the country boasts numerous world leaders in the sector.!!\\\\xa0Lessons for SMRs from comparable industriesThe costs SMRs will have to achieve to compete with other forms of baseload power will vary by country, with analysis showing the average cost of producing electricity over their lifetime needs to be between €52 €/MWh in Sweden and €119 €/MWh in Greece.For this to be attainable, SMRs and their components must be compatible with large-scale production to reach economies of scale. In terms of supply chains, SMR designs based on light water technology and that operate in a similar way to conventional reactors may have an advantage over Gen IV designs, as an extensive LNPP international supply chain already exists.However, while LNPPs are normally tailored to specific customer needs and local regulations, SMRs will rely on common, standardized components manufactured centrally and shipped to the construction site.

The outlook for the industry is being transformed by climate change policies, shifting energy priorities and technological advances. But delivery of a new generation of nuclear facilities could be compromised unless lessons are learned from past projects and the nuclear sector’s endemic cost and schedule overruns.The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts 2025 will mark an all-time high for nuclear power generation as output increases in France, Japanese plants start up again after the pause following the 2011 Fukushima disaster, and commercial reactors begin operations in many markets, including Europe, China, India, and Korea.[1] the US too new output is coming online. The first new-builds in 30 years – Vogtle 3 and 4 in Georgia – have entered commercial service. The Palisades plant in Michigan is scheduled to come back online this year after a $2 billion upgrade following its closure in 2022.[2] US and other governments are supporting this nuclear comeback to meet increased electricity demand and climate goals. Although the new Trump administration has already made moves to drop other low-carbon policy initiatives and funding, nuclear plant licences have been extended, and nuclear projects usually command bipartisan support.[3] (and in some American states), climate policies will drive nuclear expansion. Nuclear energy must make a growing contribution – alongside renewables – if the world is to decarbonize electricity generation. In December 2023, more than 20 countries from four continents at the COP28 climate action summit in Dubai signed a declaration to triple nuclear capacity to achieve global net zero by 2050.[4] European Union has given nuclear power the ‘green’ light for funding to promote sustainability.[5] transition to clean energy is also enabling China – which plans to double its nuclear capacity by 2030 – to reduce air pollution from coal-powered plants in major cities. Other Asian countries face similar challenges.As coal is phased out, wind and solar power have become a bigger source of energy, but renewable energy is intermittent in the absence of large-scale battery storage. Nuclear can provide a reliable baseload supply. Having nuclear in the mix can also protect a nation’s energy security. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine highlighted Europe’s dependence on imported fossil fuels.Meanwhile, the electrification of transport and other industries, and the expansion of data centres running power-hungry AI is stoking demand. In 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that electricity consumption by data centres, AI and the cryptocurrency sector could double by 2026. Electrification needs to accelerate rapidly on the IEA’s pathway for net zero by 2050. Electricity’s share in final energy consumption, which was up from 18% in 2015 to 20% in 2023, would approach 30% in 2030.[6] Tech as well as some other industrial users and governments are willing to pay a premium for secure, low-carbon power. In the US, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have struck high-value purchase agreements with nuclear generators. The energy will be supplied by a mixture of currently operating and recommissioned plants and a new generation of small modular reactors (SMRs).[7] 20-year contract (with Constellation, America’s largest nuclear operator) will help restart a mothballed reactor at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania. The facility is expected to produce 835 megawatts of power to offset Microsoft’s data centre electricity needs.[8] and Google are also investing in start-ups developing SMRs,[9]\\\\xa0… Continue reading while Meta has released requests for proposals from providers of 1-4 gigawatts of nuclear generation capacity to power data centres needed for AI.### **SMRs – small, modular and repeatable?**With outputs up to 300 megawatts, SMRs promise a more flexible and affordable nuclear option for supplanting fossil fuel power stations. Conventional larger-scale nuclear reactors can be challenged by their upfront capital costs and construction timelines. Some are projecting that building SMRs could take less than half the construction time for large reactors.[10] Manufacturing modules in controlled factory settings may increase efficiency and assure quality. Modular designs also allow capacity to be increased incrementally, further reducing financing risk.Apart from American SMR-powered nuclear submarines, the first SMR units are already operating in China and Russia. As with solar and wind technology, China gained an advantage on the West in SMR nuclear technology, while Russia leads in SMR fuel production. The US government and companies have been investing in SMR technology to catch up.[11] countries – including Canada and the UK – are also backing SMR technology and its export potential.[12] Some years away from commercial scale, there are said to be more than 80 SMR designs using diverse technologies at different stages of development globally.[13] Demonstration projects later this decade could pave the way for a rollout of commercial SMR fleets beginning in the 2030s.[14] of SMRs believe that their smaller scale and simpler designs should allow standardization and cost-effective manufacturing and assembly. This product-based approach – modelled on ‘shipyard’ production – could improve cost and schedule performance.[15]### The case for caution in nuclear constructionOur global experience of major nuclear engineering and construction projects – and other sectors (including shipbuilding) – teaches caution.Early SMRs will be first-of-a-kind projects with the associated risks and uncertainties that entails. In 2023 the first planned SMR in the US was cancelled due to rising construction costs and an electricity price uncompetitive with wind and solar.[16] Costs and delays could arise as the industry adapts to new designs and processes. This may also apply to the new generation of ‘advanced nuclear reactors’ using futuristic technologies (that some SMRs may leverage), such as molten salt, high-temperature gas cooling and sodium cooling, and travelling wave designs.[17] shorter SMR construction schedules do not guarantee programme certainty. Building a downsized reactor is still a complex capital project. Units should be easier to deploy – on brownfield sites of retired coal-fired plants, for example, or off-grid to provide power or heat to industry. Every location has unique features that can challenge contractors, however., which analyses the incidence and causes of claims and disputes, confirms the comparatively poor record of nuclear projects. Over the seven-year timeframe to 2024, disputed costs averaged 62.8% of budgeted capital expenditure on 27 nuclear projects in seven countries. This was notably higher than for power stations fuelled by fossil fuels (74 projects in total, in 32 countries), which faced overruns of 40.7%.![]( extensions of time claimed by contractors were highest on European nuclear projects – averaging 74% of planned schedules, and three times longer than in the Middle East (the region with the longest overruns for all infrastructure and capital projects).[18]CRUX data for time extensions on US nuclear projects is not cited here as it includes claims for the additional costs of storing spent nuclear due to breach of contract over the federal\\\\xa0… Continue readingResultant distress may be higher, but most of the main causes of claims and disputes on nuclear projects are shared with other types of construction projects. Change in scope, the primary and near-universal driver of conflict in construction, was nearly twice as likely to affect nuclear projects (34.5%) as fossil power stations.Another, related cause was late design information (24.1%). Immature designs not only make conflicts and delays during construction more likely, they also make it difficult to verify cost estimates and schedules. Optimism bias is by no means unique to the nuclear sector, but unrealistic budgets and schedules and the significant overruns that result can derail projects.[19]National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2023. Laying the Foundation for New and Advanced Nuclear Reactors in the United States.  ### Learning the lessons of past failuresCosts have ballooned on EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) contracts for nuclear plant projects around the world. This has often arisen from the civil (non-nuclear) construction element, according to a 2023 US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report on new nuclear construction.[20]National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2023. Laying the Foundation for New and Advanced Nuclear Reactors in the United States. Global in scope, the report also noted that past studies had cited ‘negative learning for nuclear.’It is no surprise that most recurrent causes of conflict across the CRUX database of 2,000 projects are also prominent in the nuclear sector. Poor management of subcontractors and their interfaces affected almost one in four nuclear projects (24.1%); and clashes over contract interpretation even more (27.6%).Alleged bias or failure to cooperate was far more common in nuclear (17.2%) than fossil power (2.9%) projects, perhaps reflecting a greater cultural diversity of project partners, if not sheer complexity.Part of that complexity arises from the regulatory requirements around nuclear safety. CRUX indicates that nuclear projects were more likely to be affected by late approvals than fossil fuel power stations (20.7% vs. 8.8%) or all non-nuclear power projects(16.5%). Such delays may be due to the procedures of either/both employers and regulators. Inadequate responses to information requests were also notably more common in the nuclear sector than in the power sector as a whole (20.7% vs. 8.1%). However, poor interface management with third parties was blamed for disputes on a slightly smaller proportion of nuclear than non-nuclear power projects (10.3% vs. 13.2%).Some argue skills shortages are to be expected in an industry that has been stagnant for many years. The IEA identified investment in human capital as a priority for countries committing to nuclear growth. Utilities have generally not retained the staff needed to execute large nuclear projects. Many megaproject owners rely on outsourced technical expertise, and lack the capacity to oversee projects (which is not unique to the nuclear industry).[21]National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2023. Laying the Foundation for New and Advanced Nuclear Reactors in the United States. Much of the global construction industry suffers from skills gaps and problems with workmanship. The US, for example, has a shortfall in mechanical and electrical engineering talent, as well as critical trades such as welding.![]( More proactive reactor constructionAs much as $1.5 trillion could be invested in the nuclear renaissance through to 2050,[22] but the scale and unpredictability of construction costs remain a major obstacle. Citing past cost and schedule overruns, an investment analysis of the European nuclear market calls for new frameworks to mitigate the construction risks and attract capital.[23] CRUX research and some of the other evidence explored here point to some essential guardrails for new-build nuclear projects.At the outset, challenge sessions and war gaming can help crystallize the risks and choices for investors, promoters and other stakeholders. Independent checks of cost estimates and schedules by industry experts can mitigate optimism bias. The earlier the design is completed on a project, the fewer associated delays are likely to be encountered, and the greater chance the project will be delivered on time and budget.A proactive approach by project employers and fairly balanced allocation of risks among the parties will improve risk management and foster more productive working relationships with EPC contractors. Intelligent use of BIM (building information modelling) can enhance coordination and construction management. The potential benefits over the life cycle of both the project and operations may justify the creation of digital twins. During construction, comprehensive risk registers and robust project controls remain essential to keep projects on track.Notwithstanding new funding models, most nuclear projects worldwide rely on some level of government support – not only financial, but also to address skills shortages and regulatory risk. In the US, for example, the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act recognised the need to fund the training of a new generation of nuclear engineers and fill gaps in other project-critical professions and trades.Meanwhile, project teams can tailor design processes to align with regulation so that approvals overlap with design progress to minimise hold-ups. The ability to replicate proven SMRs should ease this regulatory burden. International efforts to streamline and harmonise design certification are also encouraging.[24] the project level, a proactive approach to engineering and construction will be needed to mitigate risk and avoid past pitfalls, enabling cost-effective delivery of the nuclear renaissance.### About the authorKim Reome is a specialist in damages analysis in the construction and electric utility industries with over 30 years’ experience.

(Photo: D. Calma/IAEA)There is growing global interest in nuclear energy, and countries are acting on this interest. In the opening session of the Scientific Forum, the President of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo, shared his plans for the inclusion of nuclear energy in the country’s electricity generation mix. “We’re committed to a clean, equitable energy transition that harnesses the full potential of all low carbon sources, including nuclear power,” President Akufo-Addo said. “Nuclear power will play a significant part in this transformation.”\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Ghana is analysing small modular reactors (SMRs) and their potential for rapid deployment for clean and affordable energy. “We are working with industry experts to study the feasibility of deploying this new technology in Ghana,” President Akufo-Addo said.\\\\xa0In the United States of America, where nuclear power provides the single largest source of clean energy, “reaching our 2050 net zero goals depends on at least tripling our nuclear energy capacity to 300 gigawatts or more,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm. The US Government has invested “billions of dollars in the future of nuclear energy, creating historic tax incentives for investments in new facilities and production of nuclear energy,” and the development of a domestic fuel supply chain is underway, she added\\\\xa0\\\\xa0The US Department of Energy recently released , a set of reports to accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies, including advanced nuclear reactors. Advanced reactors are key to reaching net zero goals because they can help to decarbonize energy intensive industries, such as hydrogen production, desalination, district heating, petroleum refining and fertilizer production, Secretary Granholm said. She encouraged more countries to look at nuclear energy as a sustainable, long term investment and to harness “the power of the atom for a new era of peace and prosperity in what is potentially the greatest peace project of our time – a net zero world.”\\\\xa0The Republic of Korea is also investing in growing its nuclear sector. Since 2000, Korea has been implementing its Nuclear Power System Development Plan, with a specific focus on developing advanced reactors, and as a result, in 2012, Korea’s first SMR – SMART – received the standard design approval from the Korean regulator, said Lee Jong-Ho, Minister of Science and ICT in the Republic of Korea. “Now we are developing an even more advanced and innovative SMR based on SMART technology,” he added.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0The Korean Government believes that the private sector should take the lead in technological innovations. “This is especially true for the SMR sector, which aims to replace fossil fuels in industries such as seawater desalination and space exploration,” Minister Jong-Ho said. The Korean Government is launching the Korea SMR Initiative to transfer SMART and other advanced nuclear technologies to the private sector in order to help demonstrate and commercialize new reactors. “To kick start these efforts, starting next year, the Government will collaborate with the relevant companies to invest in developing high temperature gas reactors designed for industrial process heat with applications such as hydrogen production and other uses,” he said.\\\\xa0In Morocco, the Government is considering adding nuclear power to its energy mix to ensure a reliable energy supply. “Morocco places a distinct focus on small modular reactors due to their numerous advantages, including the flexibility for integration,” said Leila Benali, Morocco’s Minister of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development, in a video statement to the Forum. “They hold significant promise for diverse applications, such as combined heat and power generation and seawater desalination.”\\\\xa0Minister Benali also announced that Morocco’s National Centre for Nuclear Energy, Sciences and Technology has been designated as an , enabling it to function as a global learning platform. “Morocco\\\\\\'s national infrastructure that is now reinforced by this recognition is open for the benefit of the African continent with a focus on capacity building,” she said.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0For the past 40 years, Sweden has expanded different forms of renewable energy, with wind power providing a significant share of electricity, and biomass replacing oil and coal for district heating and industrial processes. “What was forgotten, though, was that the power system is very sensitive and that it has to work technically. It\\\\\\'s not just about adding terawatt hours,” said Sweden’s Vice Minister for Climate and the Environment, Daniel Westlén. Considering the requirement for dispatchable energy to meet demand, when and where needed, as well as for demand to be met without carbon emissions, the options are limited. “Nuclear energy is the only option available,” he added.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0To reach climate and net zero goals, studies have estimated a doubling or tripling of nuclear energy capacity by 2050. “Can the world build 20 or even 40 gigawatts of nuclear energy per year? I would claim it is possible. We’ve done it before,” Vice Minister Westlén said. In the 1980s, more than 180 reactors were under construction globally, and more than 30 gigawatts were added in one single year, he explained. Sweden deployed 12 large reactors between 1972 and 1985. While “climate change is the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced… we are in possession of the tools that we will need to solve this,” he concluded.\\\\xa0Last year, French President Emmanuel Macron announced a programme to build six nuclear reactors, as well as a programme dedicated to nuclear and innovation with small and advanced modular reactors. “We need energy, which is at the same time cheap, affordable and sustainable. And that\\\\\\'s not so easy to solve,” said François Jacq, General Administrator of the French Atomic Energy Commission. “That\\\\\\'s why we need innovation.” Innovation will come in many forms – in applications, approaches and technologies – and will also attract the future generation to the nuclear field.\\\\xa0“We will also have to innovate in the field of cooperation, in partnership. We have to invent new forms of cooperation. We have to invent new forms of research and technology organization,” General Administrator Jacq said.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0![]( energy influencer, Isabelle Boemeke, provided the keynote address at the opening session of the\\\\xa0Scientific Forum, Nuclear Innovations for Net Zero, at the IAEA 67th General Conference in Vienna, Austria, 26 September 2023. (Photo: D. Calma/IAEA)Wrapping up the opening session, Brazilian-born nuclear energy influencer Isabelle Boemeke, reflected on the power of social media to inform young audiences. “Social media can sound superficial, but the reality is that\\\\\\'s how young people learn about the world,” said Boemeke, also known as . “They trust influencers’ opinions on products, health tips and ideas. And while we\\\\\\'ve seen social media being used for bad, I believe we can leverage these tools and actually use it for good.”\\\\xa0She brought attention to the value of leaders in listening and engaging with young generations. “Young people are very much open to it, and they\\\\\\'re waiting to hear from people, like yourselves, that it\\\\\\'s OK to support this technology. Getting the population informed on all the benefits grants license to our leaders to pursue realistic decarbonization paths\\\\xa0– paths that very boldly include nuclear power at the heart,” Boemke said. Encouraging the audience of decision makers to be courageous, she concluded by asking, “Are you leaders or followers?”\\\\xa0Read  in the latest \\\\xa0![]( Scientific Forum featured a panel of young professionals in the nuclear field. They discussed their motivation to pursue a career in nuclear and the importance of diversity and inclusion. (Photo: H. Shaffer/IAEA)The Forum included a segment on youth, featuring a panel of young professionals in the nuclear field: Benjamin Bertaux, Junior Decommissioning Expert at the IAEA; Loretta Boahemaa Manu, Associate Transport Safety Officer at the IAEA; Yvonne Lin, Nuclear Engineering Intern at the IAEA; and Grace Stanke, nuclear energy advocate and current-Miss America. They expressed how \"cool\" and attractive the nuclear field is for new generations and the importance of creating collaborative research projects with universities to expose students to various career paths. Insisting on the importance of promoting diversity and inclusion in the nuclear industry, the panel shared that to attract new talent, it is as much about the science as it is about storytelling and innovative ways to communicate about nuclear.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Boahemaa Manu and Lin are both fellows of the , which is open for applicants until 30 September.\\\\xa0The way forward---------------From China to the United Kingdom and beyond, countries around the world have ambitious plans to expand their nuclear fleets. By 2035, China expects to build 150 new nuclear reactors. “We have so many coal-fired power stations that must be replaced by nuclear power,” said Yu Jianfeng,\\\\u202fChairman of China National Nuclear Corporation, during the closing session of the Forum on Wednesday.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0In the United Kingdom, “we have an ambitious target of 24 gigawatts of nuclear power to be on the UK grid by 2050,” said Andrew Bowie, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and Minister for Nuclear and Networks. “As vital as it is to decarbonize our energy baseload, it is also about prices – the cost of living, affordable energy, and being energy secure and independent.”\\\\xa0\\\\xa0When it comes to prices, Finland’s Minister of Climate and Environment, Kai Mykkänen, told the Forum that Finland’s Olkiluoto 3, Europe’s largest nuclear reactor at 1.6 gigawatts, has led to the lowest electricity prices in Finland in years. Olkiluoto 3, which began regular output in April, is the key reason Finland has ceased direct electricity and natural gas imports, while simultaneously lowering electricity prices, he said.\\\\xa0Public acceptance, as well as financing, surrounding nuclear power must also be considered in the path forward. “We have to interact with society to ensure the technical solutions we propose will be, in the end, accepted,” said Peter Baeten, Director General of the Belgian Nuclear Research Center SCK CEN. Furthermore, while technical innovation is essential, there are other aspects of innovation, said Sama Bilbao,\\\\u202fDirector General of World Nuclear Association. “We need innovation in the way we finance new nuclear. We need to think outside the box to attract investment into these nuclear projects,” she added.\\\\xa0Given the speed and scale of innovation within the nuclear field, Director General Grossi is optimistic. “There are challenges, but it is clear – we are moving decisively. We are moving, perhaps, at different paces and in different ways,” he said. “The end result will not be uniform because there is not a one-size-fits-all solution. But we can see how nuclear is very firmly positioned in this global effort that is taking place now.”\\\\xa0\\\\xa0![]( closing session of the Scientific Forum at the IAEA 67th General Conference held at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, Austria, 27 September 2023.

(Photo: D. Calma/IAEA)There is growing global interest in nuclear energy, and countries are acting on this interest. In the opening session of the Scientific Forum, the President of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo, shared his plans for the inclusion of nuclear energy in the country’s electricity generation mix. “We’re committed to a clean, equitable energy transition that harnesses the full potential of all low carbon sources, including nuclear power,” President Akufo-Addo said. “Nuclear power will play a significant part in this transformation.”\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Ghana is analysing small modular reactors (SMRs) and their potential for rapid deployment for clean and affordable energy. “We are working with industry experts to study the feasibility of deploying this new technology in Ghana,” President Akufo-Addo said.\\\\xa0In the United States of America, where nuclear power provides the single largest source of clean energy, “reaching our 2050 net zero goals depends on at least tripling our nuclear energy capacity to 300 gigawatts or more,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm. The US Government has invested “billions of dollars in the future of nuclear energy, creating historic tax incentives for investments in new facilities and production of nuclear energy,” and the development of a domestic fuel supply chain is underway, she added\\\\xa0\\\\xa0The US Department of Energy recently released , a set of reports to accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies, including advanced nuclear reactors. Advanced reactors are key to reaching net zero goals because they can help to decarbonize energy intensive industries, such as hydrogen production, desalination, district heating, petroleum refining and fertilizer production, Secretary Granholm said. She encouraged more countries to look at nuclear energy as a sustainable, long term investment and to harness “the power of the atom for a new era of peace and prosperity in what is potentially the greatest peace project of our time – a net zero world.”\\\\xa0The Republic of Korea is also investing in growing its nuclear sector. Since 2000, Korea has been implementing its Nuclear Power System Development Plan, with a specific focus on developing advanced reactors, and as a result, in 2012, Korea’s first SMR – SMART – received the standard design approval from the Korean regulator, said Lee Jong-Ho, Minister of Science and ICT in the Republic of Korea. “Now we are developing an even more advanced and innovative SMR based on SMART technology,” he added.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0The Korean Government believes that the private sector should take the lead in technological innovations. “This is especially true for the SMR sector, which aims to replace fossil fuels in industries such as seawater desalination and space exploration,” Minister Jong-Ho said. The Korean Government is launching the Korea SMR Initiative to transfer SMART and other advanced nuclear technologies to the private sector in order to help demonstrate and commercialize new reactors. “To kick start these efforts, starting next year, the Government will collaborate with the relevant companies to invest in developing high temperature gas reactors designed for industrial process heat with applications such as hydrogen production and other uses,” he said.\\\\xa0In Morocco, the Government is considering adding nuclear power to its energy mix to ensure a reliable energy supply. “Morocco places a distinct focus on small modular reactors due to their numerous advantages, including the flexibility for integration,” said Leila Benali, Morocco’s Minister of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development, in a video statement to the Forum. “They hold significant promise for diverse applications, such as combined heat and power generation and seawater desalination.”\\\\xa0Minister Benali also announced that Morocco’s National Centre for Nuclear Energy, Sciences and Technology has been designated as an , enabling it to function as a global learning platform. “Morocco\\\\\\'s national infrastructure that is now reinforced by this recognition is open for the benefit of the African continent with a focus on capacity building,” she said.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0For the past 40 years, Sweden has expanded different forms of renewable energy, with wind power providing a significant share of electricity, and biomass replacing oil and coal for district heating and industrial processes. “What was forgotten, though, was that the power system is very sensitive and that it has to work technically. It\\\\\\'s not just about adding terawatt hours,” said Sweden’s Vice Minister for Climate and the Environment, Daniel Westlén. Considering the requirement for dispatchable energy to meet demand, when and where needed, as well as for demand to be met without carbon emissions, the options are limited. “Nuclear energy is the only option available,” he added.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0To reach climate and net zero goals, studies have estimated a doubling or tripling of nuclear energy capacity by 2050. “Can the world build 20 or even 40 gigawatts of nuclear energy per year? I would claim it is possible. We’ve done it before,” Vice Minister Westlén said. In the 1980s, more than 180 reactors were under construction globally, and more than 30 gigawatts were added in one single year, he explained. Sweden deployed 12 large reactors between 1972 and 1985. While “climate change is the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced… we are in possession of the tools that we will need to solve this,” he concluded.\\\\xa0Last year, French President Emmanuel Macron announced a programme to build six nuclear reactors, as well as a programme dedicated to nuclear and innovation with small and advanced modular reactors. “We need energy, which is at the same time cheap, affordable and sustainable. And that\\\\\\'s not so easy to solve,” said François Jacq, General Administrator of the French Atomic Energy Commission. “That\\\\\\'s why we need innovation.” Innovation will come in many forms – in applications, approaches and technologies – and will also attract the future generation to the nuclear field.\\\\xa0“We will also have to innovate in the field of cooperation, in partnership. We have to invent new forms of cooperation. We have to invent new forms of research and technology organization,” General Administrator Jacq said.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0![]( energy influencer, Isabelle Boemeke, provided the keynote address at the opening session of the\\\\xa0Scientific Forum, Nuclear Innovations for Net Zero, at the IAEA 67th General Conference in Vienna, Austria, 26 September 2023. (Photo: D. Calma/IAEA)Wrapping up the opening session, Brazilian-born nuclear energy influencer Isabelle Boemeke, reflected on the power of social media to inform young audiences. “Social media can sound superficial, but the reality is that\\\\\\'s how young people learn about the world,” said Boemeke, also known as . “They trust influencers’ opinions on products, health tips and ideas. And while we\\\\\\'ve seen social media being used for bad, I believe we can leverage these tools and actually use it for good.”\\\\xa0She brought attention to the value of leaders in listening and engaging with young generations. “Young people are very much open to it, and they\\\\\\'re waiting to hear from people, like yourselves, that it\\\\\\'s OK to support this technology. Getting the population informed on all the benefits grants license to our leaders to pursue realistic decarbonization paths\\\\xa0– paths that very boldly include nuclear power at the heart,” Boemke said. Encouraging the audience of decision makers to be courageous, she concluded by asking, “Are you leaders or followers?”\\\\xa0Read  in the latest \\\\xa0![]( Scientific Forum featured a panel of young professionals in the nuclear field. They discussed their motivation to pursue a career in nuclear and the importance of diversity and inclusion. (Photo: H. Shaffer/IAEA)The Forum included a segment on youth, featuring a panel of young professionals in the nuclear field: Benjamin Bertaux, Junior Decommissioning Expert at the IAEA; Loretta Boahemaa Manu, Associate Transport Safety Officer at the IAEA; Yvonne Lin, Nuclear Engineering Intern at the IAEA; and Grace Stanke, nuclear energy advocate and current-Miss America. They expressed how \"cool\" and attractive the nuclear field is for new generations and the importance of creating collaborative research projects with universities to expose students to various career paths. Insisting on the importance of promoting diversity and inclusion in the nuclear industry, the panel shared that to attract new talent, it is as much about the science as it is about storytelling and innovative ways to communicate about nuclear.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Boahemaa Manu and Lin are both fellows of the , which is open for applicants until 30 September.\\\\xa0The way forward---------------From China to the United Kingdom and beyond, countries around the world have ambitious plans to expand their nuclear fleets. By 2035, China expects to build 150 new nuclear reactors. “We have so many coal-fired power stations that must be replaced by nuclear power,” said Yu Jianfeng,\\\\u202fChairman of China National Nuclear Corporation, during the closing session of the Forum on Wednesday.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0In the United Kingdom, “we have an ambitious target of 24 gigawatts of nuclear power to be on the UK grid by 2050,” said Andrew Bowie, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and Minister for Nuclear and Networks. “As vital as it is to decarbonize our energy baseload, it is also about prices – the cost of living, affordable energy, and being energy secure and independent.”\\\\xa0\\\\xa0When it comes to prices, Finland’s Minister of Climate and Environment, Kai Mykkänen, told the Forum that Finland’s Olkiluoto 3, Europe’s largest nuclear reactor at 1.6 gigawatts, has led to the lowest electricity prices in Finland in years. Olkiluoto 3, which began regular output in April, is the key reason Finland has ceased direct electricity and natural gas imports, while simultaneously lowering electricity prices, he said.\\\\xa0Public acceptance, as well as financing, surrounding nuclear power must also be considered in the path forward. “We have to interact with society to ensure the technical solutions we propose will be, in the end, accepted,” said Peter Baeten, Director General of the Belgian Nuclear Research Center SCK CEN. Furthermore, while technical innovation is essential, there are other aspects of innovation, said Sama Bilbao,\\\\u202fDirector General of World Nuclear Association. “We need innovation in the way we finance new nuclear. We need to think outside the box to attract investment into these nuclear projects,” she added.\\\\xa0Given the speed and scale of innovation within the nuclear field, Director General Grossi is optimistic. “There are challenges, but it is clear – we are moving decisively. We are moving, perhaps, at different paces and in different ways,” he said. “The end result will not be uniform because there is not a one-size-fits-all solution. But we can see how nuclear is very firmly positioned in this global effort that is taking place now.”\\\\xa0\\\\xa0![]( closing session of the Scientific Forum at the IAEA 67th General Conference held at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, Austria, 27 September 2023.

Initially, fusion research in the USA and USSR was linked to atomic weapons development, and it remained classified until the 1958 Atoms for Peace conference in Geneva. Following a breakthrough at the Soviet tokamak, fusion research became \\\\\\'big science\\\\\\' in the 1970s. But the cost and complexity of the devices involved increased to the point where international co-operation was the only way forward.\\\\xa0The Fusion Industry Association report \")\\\\xa0said that $2.83 billion of new investment was declared by private nuclear fusion companies since the 2021 edition of the report.Fusion powers the Sun and stars as hydrogen atoms fuse together to form helium, and matter is converted into energy. Hydrogen, heated to very high temperatures changes from a gas to a plasma in which the negatively-charged electrons are separated from the positively-charged atomic nuclei (ions). Normally, fusion is not possible because the strongly repulsive electrostatic forces between the positively charged nuclei prevent them from getting close enough together to collide and for fusion to occur. However, if the conditions are such that the nuclei can overcome the electrostatic forces to the extent that they can come within a very close range of each other, then the attractive nuclear force (which binds protons and neutrons together in atomic nuclei) between the nuclei will outweigh the repulsive (electrostatic) force, allowing the nuclei to fuse together. Such conditions can occur when the temperature increases, causing the ions to move faster and eventually reach speeds high enough to bring the ions close enough together. The nuclei can then fuse, causing a release of energy.Fusion technology-----------------In the Sun, massive gravitational forces create the right conditions for fusion, but on Earth they are much harder to achieve. Fusion fuel – different isotopes of hydrogen – must be heated to extreme temperatures of the order of 50 million degrees Celsius, and must be kept stable under intense pressure, hence dense enough and confined for long enough to allow the nuclei to fuse. The aim of the controlled fusion research program is to achieve \\\\\\'ignition\\\\\\', which occurs when enough fusion reactions take place for the process to become self-sustaining, with fresh fuel then being added to continue it.\\\\xa0Once ignition is achieved, there is net energy yield – about four times as much as with nuclear fission. According to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the amount of power produced increases with the square of the pressure, so doubling the pressure leads to a fourfold increase in energy production.With current technology, the reaction most readily feasible is between the nuclei of the two heavy forms (isotopes) of hydrogen – deuterium (D) and tritium (T). Each D-T fusion event releases 17.6 MeV (2.8 x 10-12 joule, compared with 200 MeV for a U-235 fission and 3-4 MeV for D-D fusion). On a mass basis, the D-T fusion reaction releases over four times as much energy as uranium fission. Deuterium occurs naturally in seawater (30 grams per cubic metre), which makes it very abundant relative to other energy resources. Tritium occurs naturally only in trace quantities (produced by cosmic rays) and is radioactive, with a half-life of around 12 years. Usable quantities can be made in a conventional nuclear reactor, or in the present context, bred in a fusion system from lithium. Lithium is found in large quantities (30 parts per million) in the Earth\\\\\\'s crust and in weaker concentrations in the sea.In a fusion reactor, the concept is that neutrons generated from the D-T fusion reaction will be absorbed in a blanket containing lithium which surrounds the core. The lithium is then transformed into tritium (which is used to fuel the reactor) and helium. The blanket must be thick enough (about 1 metre) to slow down the\\\\xa0high-energy (14 MeV) neutrons. The kinetic energy of the neutrons is absorbed by the blanket, causing it to heat up. The heat energy is collected by the coolant (water, helium or Li-Pb eutectic) flowing through the blanket and, in a fusion power plant, this energy will be used to generate electricity by conventional methods.\\\\xa0If insufficient tritium is produced, some supplementary source must be employed such as using a fission reactor to irradiate heavy water or lithium with neutrons, and extraneous tritium creates difficulties with handling, storage and transport.The difficulty has been to develop a device that can heat the D-T fuel to a high enough temperature and confine it long enough so that more energy is released through fusion reactions than is used to get the reaction going. While the D-T reaction is the main focus of attention, long-term hopes are for a D-D reaction, but this requires much higher temperatures.In any case, the challenge is to apply the heat to human needs, primarily generating electricity. The energy density of fusion reactions in gas is very much less than for fission reactions in solid fuel, and as noted the heat yield per reaction is 70 times less. Hence thermonuclear fusion will always have a much lower power density than nuclear fission, which means that any fusion reactor needs to be larger and therefore more costly, than a fission reactor of the same power output. In addition, nuclear fission reactors use solid fuel which is denser than a thermonuclear plasma, so the energy released is more concentrated.\\\\xa0Also the neutron energy from fusion is higher than from fission – 14.1 MeV instead of about 2 MeV, which presents significant challenges regarding structural materials.At present, two main experimental approaches are being studied: magnetic confinement and inertial confinement. The first method uses strong magnetic fields to contain the hot plasma. The second involves compressing a small pellet containing fusion fuel to extremely high densities using strong lasers or particle beams.\\\\xa0A range of magnetized target fusion systems are also being developed, along with experiments with hybrid fusion.### Magnetic confinementIn magnetic confinement fusion (MCF), hundreds of cubic metres of D-T plasma at a density of less than a milligram per cubic metre are confined by a magnetic field at a few atmospheres pressure and heated to fusion temperature.Magnetic fields are ideal for confining a plasma because the electrical charges on the separated ions and electrons mean that they follow the magnetic field lines. The aim is to prevent the particles from coming into contact with the reactor walls as this will dissipate their heat and slow them down. The most effective magnetic configuration is toroidal, shaped like a doughnut, in which the magnetic field is curved around to form a closed loop. For proper confinement, this toroidal field must have superimposed upon it a perpendicular field component (a poloidal field). The result is a magnetic field with force lines following spiral (helical) paths that confine and control the plasma.There are several types of toroidal confinement system, the most important being tokamaks, stellarators and reversed field pinch (RFP) devices.In a tokamak, the toroidal field is created by a series of coils evenly spaced around the torus-shaped reactor, and the poloidal field is created by a system of horizontal coils outside the toroidal magnet structure. A strong electric current is induced in the plasma using a central solenoid, and this induced current also contributes to the poloidal field. In a stellarator, the helical lines of force are produced by a series of coils which may themselves be helical in shape. Unlike tokamaks, stellarators do not require a toroidal current to be induced in the plasma. RFP devices have the same toroidal and poloidal components as a tokamak, but the current flowing through the plasma is much stronger and the direction of the toroidal field within the plasma is reversed.In tokamaks and RFP devices, the current flowing through the plasma also serves to heat it to a temperature of about 10 million degrees Celsius. Beyond that, additional heating systems are needed to achieve the temperatures necessary for fusion. In stellarators, these heating systems have to supply all the energy needed.The tokamak (_toroidalnya kamera ee magnetnaya katushka_ – torus-shaped magnetic chamber) was designed in 1951 by Soviet physicists Andrei Sakharov and Igor Tamm. Tokamaks operate within limited parameters outside which sudden losses of energy confinement (disruptions) can occur, causing major thermal and mechanical stresses to the structure and walls. Nevertheless, it is considered the most promising design, and research is continuing on various tokamaks around the world.Research is also being carried out on several types of stellarator. Lyman Spitzer devised and began work on the first fusion device – a stellarator – at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory in 1951. Due to the difficulty in confining plasmas, stellarators fell out of favour until computer modelling techniques allowed accurate geometries to be calculated. Because stellarators have no toroidal plasma current, plasma stability is increased compared with tokamaks. Since the burning plasma can be more easily controlled and monitored, stellerators have an intrinsic potential for steady-state, continuous operation. The disadvantage is that, due to their more complex shape, stellarators are much more complex than tokamaks to design and build.RFP devices differ from tokamaks mainly in the spatial distribution of the toroidal magnetic field, which changes sign at the edge of the plasma. The RFX machine in Padua, Italy is used to study the physical problems arising from the spontaneous reorganization of the magnetic field, which is an intrinsic feature of this configuration.### Inertial confinementIn inertial confinement fusion, which is a newer line of research, laser or ion beams are focused very precisely onto the surface of a target, which is a pellet of D-T fuel, a few millimetres in diameter. This heats the outer layer of the material, which explodes outwards generating an inward-moving compression front or implosion that compresses and heats the inner layers of material. The core of the fuel may be compressed to one thousand times its liquid density, resulting in conditions where fusion can occur. The energy released then would heat the surrounding fuel, which may also undergo fusion leading to a chain reaction (known as ignition) as the reaction spreads outwards through the fuel. The time required for these reactions to occur is limited by the inertia of the fuel (hence the name), but is less than a microsecond. So far, most inertial confinement work has involved lasers.Recent work at Osaka University\\\\\\'s Institute of Laser Engineering in Japan suggests that ignition may be achieved at lower temperature with a second very intense laser pulse guided through a millimetre-high gold cone into the compressed fuel, and timed to coincide with the peak compression. This technique, known as \\\\\\'fast ignition\\\\\\', means that fuel compression is separated from hot spot generation with ignition, making the process more practical.In the UK  based near Oxford is researching inertial fusion energy (IFE) with a focus on power driver technology using an asymmetric implosion approach. As well as power generation, the company envisages material processing and chemical manufacturing applications. In March 2025 the company announced that it would focus on providing its amplifier technology, dropping earlier plans to develop a power plant.The US  is a large laser-based inertial confinement fusion research device at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. It focuses 192 powerful laser beams into a small target in a few billionths of a second, delivering more than 2 MJ of ultraviolet energy and 500 TW of peak power.A completely different concept, the \\\\\\'Z-pinch\\\\\\' (or \\\\\\'zeta pinch\\\\\\'), uses a strong electrical current in a plasma to generate X-rays, which compress a tiny D-T fuel cylinder.### Magnetized target fusionMagnetized target fusion (MTF), also referred to as magneto-inertial fusion (MIF), is a pulsed approach to fusion that combines the compressional heating of inertial confinement fusion with the magnetically reduced thermal transport and magnetically enhanced alpha heating of magnetic confinement fusion.A range of MTF systems are currently being experimented with, and commonly use a magnetic field to confine a plasma with compressional heating provided by laser, electromagnetic or mechanical liner implosion. As a result of this combined approach, shorter plasma confinement times are required than for magnetic confinement (from 100 ns to 1 ms, depending on the MIF approach), reducing the requirement to stabilize the plasma for long periods. Conversely, compression can be achieved over timescales longer than those typical for inertial confinement, making it possible to achieve compression through mechanical, magnetic, chemical, or relatively low-powered laser drivers.Several approaches are underway to examine MTF, including experiments at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratory, the University of Rochester, and private companies General Fusion and Helion Energy.R&D challenges for MTF include whether a suitable target plasma can be formed and heated to fusion conditions while avoiding contamination from the liner, as with magnetic confinement and inertial confinement. Due to the reduced demands on confinement time and compression velocities, MTF has been pursued as a lower-cost and simpler approach to investigating these challenges than conventional fusion projects.In the UK General Fusion\\\\\\'s  at the UK Atomic Energy Authority\\\\\\'s Culham Campus, near Oxford, received planning consent for construction in January 2022. The company aims to construct a fusion energy power plant by the early 2030s.### Hybrid fusionFusion can also be combined with fission in what is referred to as hybrid nuclear fusion where the blanket surrounding the core is a subcritical fission reactor. The fusion reaction acts as a source of neutrons for the surrounding blanket, where these neutrons are captured, resulting in fission reactions taking place. These fission reactions would also produce more neutrons, thereby assisting further fission reactions in the blanket.The concept of hybrid fusion can be compared with an accelerator-driven system (ADS), where an accelerator is the source of neutrons for the blanket assembly, rather than nuclear fusion reactions (see page on ). The blanket of a hybrid fusion system can therefore contain the same fuel as an ADS – for example, the abundant element thorium or the long-lived heavy isotopes present in used nuclear fuel (from a conventional reactor) could be used as fuel.The blanket containing fission fuel in a hybrid fusion system would not require the development of new materials capable of withstanding constant neutron bombardment, whereas such materials would be needed in the blanket of a \\\\\\'conventional\\\\\\' fusion system. A further advantage of a hybrid system is that the fusion part would not need to produce as many neutrons as a (non-hybrid) fusion reactor would in order to generate more power than is consumed – so a commercial-scale fusion reactor in a hybrid system does not need to be as large as a fusion-only reactor.Fusion research---------------A long-standing quip about fusion points out that, since the 1970s, commercial deployment of fusion power has always been about 40 years away. While there is some truth in this, many breakthroughs have been made, particularly in recent years, and there are a number of major projects under development that may bring research to the point where fusion power can be commercialized.Several **tokamaks** have been built, including the Joint European Torus (JET)\\\\xa0and the Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak (MAST)\\\\xa0in the UK and the tokamak fusion test reactor (TFTR) at Princeton in the USA. The ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) project currently under construction in Cadarache, France will be the largest tokamak when it operates in the 2020s. The Chinese Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR) is a tokamak which is reported to be larger than ITER, and due for completion in 2030.\\\\xa0Meanwhile it is running its Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST). In the UK, Tokamak Energy has commissioned and is further developing its ST40 tokamak.\\\\xa0In March 2022 the US Department of Energy announced up to $50 million of federal funding to support US scientists conducting experimental research in fusion energy science. $20 million of this would support tokamak facilities, while the other $30 million would support\\\\xa0research to improve fusion performance and increase the duration of burning plasma scenarios.Much research has also been carried out on **stellarators**. A large one of these, the Large Helical Device at Japan\\\\\\'s National Institute of Fusion Research, began operating in 1998. It is being used to study the best magnetic configuration for plasma confinement. At the Garching site of the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Germany, research carried out at the Wendelstein 7-AS between 1988 and 2002 is being progressed at the Wendelstein 7-X, which was built over 19 years at Max Planck Institute\\\\\\'s Greifswald site and started up at the end of 2015. Another stellarator, TJII, is in operation in Madrid, Spain. In the USA, at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, where the first stellarators were built in 1951, construction on the NCSX stellerator was abandoned in 2008 due to cost overruns and lack of funding.There have also been significant developments in research into **inertial fusion energy** (IFE). Construction of the\\\\xa0$7 billion National Ignition Facility (NIF) at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), funded by the National Nuclear Security Administration, was completed in March 2009. The Laser Mégajoule (LMJ) in France’s Bordeaux region started operation in October 2014. Both are designed to deliver, in a few billionths of a second, nearly two million joules of light energy to targets measuring a few millimeters in size. The main purpose of both NIF and LMJ is\\\\xa0for research to support both countries\\\\\\' respective\\\\xa0nuclear weapons programs.In September 2021 the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) opened the Fusion Technology Facility at the Advanced Manufacturing Park in Rotherham. It will house test rigs including the Combined Heating and Magnetic Research Apparatus (CHIMERA), which would be the only device capable of\\\\xa0simulating\\\\xa0conditions of a fusion power plant to test prototype components.### ITERIn 1985, the Soviet Union suggested building a next generation tokamak with Europe, Japan and the USA. Collaboration was established under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Between 1988 and 1990, the initial designs were drawn up for an International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER, which also means \\\\\\'a path\\\\\\' or \\\\\\'journey\\\\\\' in Latin) with the aim of proving that fusion could produce useful energy. The four parties agreed in 1992 to collaborate further on engineering design activities for ITER. Canada and Kazakhstan are also involved through Euratom and Russia, respectively.Six years later, the ITER Council approved the first comprehensive design of a fusion reactor based on well-established physics and technology with a price tag of $6 billion. Then the USA decided pull out of the project, forcing a 50% reduction in costs and a redesign. The result was the ITER Fusion Energy Advanced Tokomak (ITER-FEAT) – initially expected to cost $3 billion but still achieve the targets of a self-sustaining reaction and a net energy gain. The envisaged energy gain is unlikely to be enough for a power plant, but it should demonstrate feasibility.In 2003, the USA rejoined the project and China also announced it would join. After deadlocked discussion, the six partners agreed in mid-2005 to site ITER at Cadarache, in southern France. The deal involved major concessions to Japan, which had put forward Rokkasho as a preferred site. The European Union (EU) and France would contribute half of the then estimated €12.8 billion total cost, with the other partners – Japan, China, South Korea, USA and Russia – putting in 10% each. Japan will provide a lot of the high-tech components, will host a €1 billion materials testing facility – the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF) – and will have the right to host a subsequent demonstration fusion reactor. India became the seventh member of the ITER consortium at the end of 2005. In November 2006, the seven members – China, India, Japan, Russia, South Korea, the USA and the European Union – signed the ITER implementing agreement.\\\\xa0The total cost of the 500 MW ITER comprises about half for the ten-year construction and half for 20 years of operation.Site preparation works at Cadarache commenced in January 2007. First concrete for the buildings was poured in December 2013. Experiments were due to begin in 2018, when hydrogen will be used to avoid activating the magnets, but this is now expected in 2035. The first D-T plasma is not expected until 2035.\\\\xa0ITER is large because confinement time increases with the cube of machine size. The vacuum vessel will be 19 m across and 11 m high, and weigh more than 5000 tonnes.The goal of ITER is to operate with a plasma thermal output of 500 MW (for at least 400 seconds continuously) with less than 50 MW of plasma heating power input. No electricity will be generated at ITER.An associated CEA facility at Cadarache is WEST, formerly Tore Supra, which is designed to test prototype components and accelerate their development for ITER. It is focused on the divertor structure to remove helium, testing the durability of tungsten materials used.A 2 GW Demonstration Power Plant, known as Demo, is expected to demonstrate large-scale production of electrical power on a continual basis. The conceptual design of Demo was expected to be completed by 2017, with construction beginning around 2024 and the first phase of operation commencing from 2033. It has since been delayed, with construction now planned for after 2040.In November 2022 it was announced that a defect had been discovered in the thermal shields and vacuum vessel of ITER. The bending and welding of cooling fluid in pipes to the thermal shield panels\\\\xa0resulted in stress corrosion cracking of up to 2.2mm deep in the pipes. Due to the risk of leaking, the installed module will\\\\xa0need to be lifted out and disassembled\\\\xa0in order to proceed with the repairs. ITER director general Pietro Barabaschi\\\\xa0said the consequences on schedule and cost \"will not be insignificant\". In March 2025 the manufacturing of the second vaccum vessel was completed.### JETIn 1978, the European Community (Euratom, along with Sweden and Switzerland) launched the Joint European Torus (JET) project in the UK. JET is the largest tokamak operating in the world today. A similar tokamak, JT-60, operates at the Naka Fusion Institute of Japan Atomic Energy Agency in Japan, but only JET has the facilities to use D-T fuel.Following a legal dispute with Euratom, in December 1999 JET\\\\\\'s international contract ended and the UKAEA\\\\xa0took over the management of JET on behalf of its European partners. From that time JET\\\\\\'s experimental programme has been co-ordinated by the European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA) parties.\\\\xa0JET is operated by the UKAEA\\\\\\'s Culham Centre for Fusion Research, a member of the EUROfusion consortium.JET produced its first plasma in 1983, and became the first experiment to produce controlled fusion power in November 1991, albeit with high input of electricity. Up to 16 MW of fusion power for one second and 5 MW sustained has been achieved in D-T plasmas using the device, from 24 MW of power injected into its heating system, and many experiments are conducted to study different heating schemes and other techniques. JET has been very successful in operating remote handling techniques in a radioactive environment to modify the interior of the device and has shown that the remote handling maintenance of fusion devices is realistic.JET is a key device in preparations for ITER. It has been significantly upgraded in recent years to test ITER plasma physics and engineering systems. Further enhancements are planned at JET with a view to exceeding its fusion power record in future D-T experiments. A compact device – Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak (MAST) – was developed alongside JET at Culham, partly to serve the ITER project, and the substantial\\\\xa0MAST Upgrade\\\\xa0project is now being implemented in stages to increase neutral beam power from 5 to 12.5 MW and the energy deposited in plasma from 2.5 to 30 MJ. MAST Upgrade is focused on designing a plasma exhaust system or divertor that would be able withstand the intense power loads created in commercial-sized fusion reactors. It achieved first plasma in October 2020.In 2019 the UK government committed £22 million over four years for the conceptual design of the Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP) at Culham. The technical objectives of STEP are: to deliver predictable net electricity greater than 100 MW; to exploit fusion energy beyond electricity production; to ensure tritium self-sufficiency; to qualify materials and components under appropriate fusion conditions of neutron flux; and to develop a viable path to affordable life-cycle costs. STEP is scheduled for completion in 2040.\\\\xa0In February 2022 researchers at JET achieved 59 megajoules of heat energy from fusion over a five-second period, doubling previous records.### Tokamak EnergyTokamak Energy in the UK is a private company developing a spherical tokamak, and hopes to commercialize this by 2030. The company grew out of Culham laboratory, home to JET, and its technology revolves around high temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets, which allow for relatively low-power and small-size devices, but high performance and potentially widespread commercial deployment. Its first tokamak with exclusively HTS magnets\\\\xa0– the ST25 HTS, Tokamak Energy\\\\\\'s second reactor\\\\xa0– demonstrated 29 hours\\\\\\' continuous plasma during the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition in London in 2015, a world record.The next reactor is the ST40 at Milton Park in Oxfordshire, which achieved first plasma in April 2017. It produced plasma temperatures of 15 million degrees Celsius in 2018 and 2019 after the commissioning of further magnetic coils. Chief executive of Tokamak Energy David Kingham said: \"The ST40 is designed to achieve 100 million degrees C and get within a factor of ten of energy break-even conditions.” The company is working with Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory on spherical tokamaks, and with the Plasma Science and Fusion Centre at MIT on HTS magnets.\\\\xa0In July 2020 it was awarded £10 million from the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), as part of the government’s Advanced Modular Reactor project. The funds will contribute to core development work on high temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets and plasma exhaust system (divertor) technologies. The divertor must handle high levels of heat and particle bombardment while removing impurities and waste from the system. It aims to have a prototype delivering electricity to the grid by 2030.### KSTARThe KSTAR (Korean Superconducting Tokamak Reactor) at the National Fusion Research Institute (NFRI) in Daejeon produced its first plasma in mid-2008. It is a pilot device for ITER, and involves much international collaboration. It will be a satellite of ITER during ITER’s operational phase. The tokamak with 1.8 metre major radius is the first to use Nb3Sn superconducting magnets, the same material to be used in the ITER project. Its first stage of development to 2012 was to prove baseline operation technologies and achieved plasma pulses of up to 20 seconds. For the second phase of development (2013-2017), KSTAR was upgraded to study long pulses of up to 300 seconds in H mode – the 100s target was in 2015 – and embark upon high-performance AT mode. It achieved 70 seconds in high-performance plasma operation in late 2016, a world record. In addition, KSTAR researchers also succeeded in achieving an alternative advanced plasma operation mode with the internal transport barrier (ITB). This is a steep pressure gradient in the core of the plasmas due to the enhanced core plasma confinement. NFRI said this is the first ITB operation achieved in the superconducting device at the lowest heating power. KSTAR Phase 3 (2018-2023) is to develop high performance, high efficiency AT mode technologies with long-pulse operation. Phase 4 (2023-2025) will test DEMO-related prior arts. The device does not have tritium handling capabilities, so will not use D-T fuel.### K-DEMO tokamakIn collaboration with the US Department of Energy\\\\\\'s Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) in New Jersey and South Korea’s National Fusion Research Institute (NFRI) K-DEMO is intended to be the next step toward commercial reactors from ITER, and would be the first plant to actually contribute power to an electric grid. According to the PPPL, it would generate \"some 1 billion watts of power for several weeks on end\", a much greater output than ITER\\\\\\'s goal of producing 500 million watts for 500 seconds by the late 2020s. K-DEMO is expected to have a 6.65m diameter major radius tokamak, and a test blanket module as part of the DEMO breeding blanket R&D. The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology plans to invest about KRW 1 trillion (US$ 941 million) in the project. About KRW 300 billion of that spending has already been funded. The government expects the project to employ nearly 2,400 people in the first phase, which will last throughout 2016. K-DEMO is expected to have an initial operational phase from about 2037 to 2050 to develop components for the second stage, which would produce electricity.### FAST (Fusion by Advanced Superconducting Tokamak)FAST aims to generate and sustain a plasma of deuterium-tritium (D-T) reactions, demonstrating an integrated fusion energy system that combines energy conversion including electricity generation and fuel technologies. To be sited in Japan, the project aims for power generation demonstration by the end of the 2030s. The aim is for power generation of 50 to 100 MW with 1000 seconds of D-T fusion burn, with the device planned to operate for a cumulative 1000 hours of full-power operation.EASTIn China the Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) at China Academy of Sciences\\\\\\' Hefei Institutes of Physical Science (HFIPS) produced hydrogen plasma at 50 million degrees Celsius and held it for 102 seconds in 2017. In November 2018 it achieved 100 million degrees Celsius for 10 seconds, with input of 10 MW of electric power. In July 2020 EAST achieved a completely non-inductive, current-driven, steady-state plasma for over 100 seconds, claimed as a breakthrough with significant implications for the future China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR). In May 2021 it set a new world record of achieving a plasma temperature of 120 million degrees Celsius for 101 seconds. The experiment also realized a plasma temperature of 160 million degrees Celsius, lasting 20 seconds.TFTRIn the USA, the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) operated at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) from 1982 to 1997. In December 1993, TFTR became the first magnetic fusion device to perform extensive experiments with plasmas composed of D-T. The following year TFTR produced 10.7 MW of controlled fusion power – a record at that time. TFTR set other records, including the achievement of a plasma temperature of 510 million degrees centigrade in 1995. However, it did not achieve its goal of break-even fusion energy (where the energy input required is no greater than the amount of fusion energy produced), but achieved all of its hardware design goals, thus making substantial contributions to the development of ITER.ALCATORAt the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) since the 1970s a succession of small ALCATOR (Alto Campus Torus) high magnetic field torus reactors have operated on the principle of achieving high plasma pressure as the route to long plasma confinement. Alcator C-Mod is claimed to have the highest magnetic field and highest plasma pressure of any fusion reactor, and is the largest university-based fusion reactor in the world. It operated 1993-2016. In September 2016 it achieved a plasma pressure of 2.05 atmospheres at a temperature of 35 million degrees Celsius. The plasma produced 300 trillion fusion reactions per second and had a central magnetic field strength of 5.7 tesla. It carried 1.4 million amps of electrical current and was heated with over 4 MW of power. The reaction occurred in a volume of approximately 1 cubic metre and the plasma lasted for two seconds. Having achieved this record performance for a fusion reactor, government funding ceased.A scaled-up version planned to be built at Triotsk near Moscow in collaboration with the Kurchatov Institute is Ignitor, with 1.3 m diameter torus.### Large Helical Device\\\\xa0– stellaratorThe Large Helical Device (LHD) at Japan\\\\\\'s National Institute for Fusion Science in Toki, in the Gifu Prefecture, was the world\\\\\\'s largest stellarator. LHD produced its first plasma in 1998 and has demonstrated plasma confinement properties comparable to other large fusion devices. It has achieved an ion temperature of 13.5 keV (about 160 million degrees) and plasma stored energy of 1.44 million joules (MJ).### Wendelstein 7-X stellaratorFollowing a year of tests, this started up at the end of 2015, and helium plasma briefly reached about one million degrees centigrade.\\\\xa0In 2016 it progressed to using hydrogen, and using 2 MW it achieved plasma of 80 million degrees centigrade for a quarter of a second. W7-X is the world’s largest stellarator and it is planned to operate continuously for up to 30 minutes. It cost €1 billion ($1.1 billion).\\\\xa0\\\\xa0  Some good diagrams are in a\\\\xa0\\\\xa0on the Wendelstein 7-X.### Heliac-1 stellaratorAt the\\\\xa0Australian Plasma Fusion Research Facility\\\\xa0at the Australian National University the H-1 stellarator has run for some years and in 2014 was upgraded significantly. H-1 is capable of accessing a wide range of plasma configurations and allows exploration of ideas for improved magnetic design of the fusion power stations that will follow ITER.### National\\\\xa0Ignition\\\\xa0Facility\\\\xa0– laserThe world\\\\\\'s most powerful laser fusion facility, the $4 billion National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), was completed in March 2009. Using its 192 laser beams, NIF is able to deliver more than 60 times the energy of any previous laser system to its target. LLNL announced in July 2012 that in \"an historic record-breaking laser shot, the NIF laser system of 192 beams delivered more than 500 TW of peak power and 1.85 megajoules (MJ) of ultraviolet laser light to its (2mm diameter) target\" for a few trillionths of a second. In September 2013 for the first time the amount of energy released through the fusion reaction (14 kJ) exceeded the amount of energy being absorbed by the fuel, but not the amount supplied by the giant lasers (1.8 MJ). In August 2021 LLNL said that it had achieved a yield of 1.3 MJ, much better than its previous best of 55 kJ in 2018. It said this was \"a historic step forward for inertial confinment\" putting it \"at the threshold of fusion ignition.\"\\\\xa0In August 2021 NIF achieved a record fusion yield of 1.3 megajoules – 24 times greater than its previous best experiment – which LLNL said places it \"at the threshold of fusion ignition\".\\\\xa0A breakthrough in December 2022 resulted in an NIF experiment demonstrating the fundamental scientific basis for inertial confinement fusion energy for the first time. The experiment created fusion ignition when using 192 laser beams to deliver more than 2 MJ of ultraviolet energy to a deuterium-tritium fuel pellet.An earlier high-power laser at LLNL, Nova, was built in 1984 for the purpose of achieving ignition. Nova failed to do this and was closed in 1999, but provided essential data that led to the design of NIF. Nova also generated considerable amounts of data on high-density matter physics, which is useful both in fusion power and nuclear weapons research.In connection with NIF, LLNL is developing the Laser Inertial Fusion Engine (LIFE), a hybrid fusion system where neutrons resulting from laser fusion would drive a subcritical nuclear fission blanket to generate electricity. The blanket would contain either depleted uranium; used nuclear fuel; natural uranium or thorium; or plutonium-239, minor actinides and fission products from reprocessed used nuclear fuel.### Laser MégajouleMeanwhile, the French Atomic Energy Commission (Commissariat à l\\\\\\'énergie atomique, CEA) has operated a similar size laser – the Laser Mégajoule (LMJ) – near Bordeaux since 2014. Its 240 laser beams are able to generate 1.8 MJ pulses for a few billionths of a second, concentrated on a small deuterium and tritium target. A prototype laser, the Ligne d\\\\\\'Integration Laser (LIL), commenced operation in 2003.### SG-IIChina’s National Laboratory of High-Power Laser and Physics, associated with the China Academy of Science, has a laser inertial confinement experiment in Shanghai – the Shenguang-II eight-beam laser facility (SG-II), similar to the National Ignition Facility in the USA and Laser Mégajoule in France. It is the only high power neodymium-glass solid laser facility with an active probe light in China.\\\\u202fIn 2005 a ninth beam was added, advancing the capacity for fusion research. The SG-II facility is China’s high-power laser technology international demonstration base.### PETAL and HiPER lasersThe Petawatt Aquitaine Laser (PETAL) laser facility is a high energy multi-petawatt laser (3.5 kJ energy with a duration of 0.5 to 5 ps) under construction near Bordeaux, on the same site as LIL. PETAL will be coupled with LIL to demonstrate the physics and laser technology of fast ignition.The High Power Laser Energy Research Facility (HiPER) is being designed to build on the research planned at the PETAL project. HiPER will use a long pulse laser (currently estimated at 200kJ) combined with a 70kJ short pulse laser. A three-year preparatory phase that commenced in 2008 has direct funding or in-kind commitments amounting to around €70 million from several countries. The detailed engineering phase is projected to begin in 2011, with a six-year construction phase possibly commencing by 2014.### Z machineOperated by Sandia National Laboratories, the Z machine is the largest X-ray generator in the world. As with NIF, the facility was built as part of the country\\\\\\'s Stockpile Stewardship Program, which aims to maintain the stockpile of nuclear weapons without the need for full-scale testing.Conditions for fusion are achieved by passing a powerful electrical pulse (lasting less than 100 nanoseconds) through a set of fine tungsten wires inside a metal hohlraum. The wires turn into a plasma and experience a compression (\\\\\\'Z-pinch\\\\\\'), forcing the vapourized particles to collide with each other, thereby producing intense X-ray radiation. A tiny cylinder containing fusion fuel placed inside the hohlraum would therefore be compressed by the X-rays, allowing fusion to occur.In 2006, Z machine had achieved temperatures of over 2 billion degrees, considerably higher than what is needed for fusion, and in theory high enough to allow nuclear fusion of hydrogen with heavier elements such as lithium or boron.### Other fusion projectsThere is a considerable amount of research into many other fusion projects at various stages of development.**Lockheed CFR**. Lockheed Martin at its so-called ‘skunk works’ is developing a  (CFR) which uses conventional D-T plasma in evacuated containment but confines it differently. Instead of constraining the plasma within tubular rings, a series of superconducting coils will generate a new magnetic-field geometry in which the plasma is held within the broader confines of the entire reaction chamber. The energy is supplied by radiofrequency heating. Superconducting magnets within the coils will generate a magnetic field around the outer border of the chamber. The aim is to go to plasma pressure being as great as confining pressure at high enough temperature for ignition and net energy yield. Heat exchangers in the reactor wall would convey energy to a gas turbine. It has progressed to a magentized ion confinement experiment, but has some way to go before any prototype, which they claim will be very much smaller than conventional designs such as the ITER tokamak.Italy\\\\\\'s National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA) is developing a small tokamak reactor by the name of **Ignitor**. Under an Italian-Russian agreement signed in May 2010, a reactor will be assembled in Italy and installed at the Kurchatov Institute\\\\\\'s Troitsk Institute for Innovation and Fusion Research (TRINITI) near Moscow.An alternative to using powerful lasers for inertial confinement fusion is \\\\\\'**heavy ion fusion**\\\\\\', where high-energy particles from an accelerator are focused using magnetic fields onto the fusion target.\\\\xa0The  (Neutralized Drift Compression Experiment II) accelerator has been used for heavy ion fusion experiments since 2012 at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. It is being expanded to deliver short intense pulses of ion beams with kinetic energy of 1.2 MeV. High-energy-density physics (HEDP) experiments with laboratory plasmas is a growing part of inertial fusion energy (IFE) physics. (Lawrenceville Plasma Physics) is a US enterprise developing aneutronic fusion using a dense plasma focus device (DPF or **focus fusion**) and hydrogen-boron fuel. The hydrogen and boron (B-11) as plasma fuse at high temperature to form a pulsed beam of helium nuclei without emitting neutrons. (The boron and hydrogen combine to produce a brief intermediate carbon-12 atom which rapidly decays to three alpha particles.) This charged high-energy ion beam generates electricity as it passes through a series of coils similar to a transformer, at 80% efficiency. The balance of energy is as by-product X-rays which are captured in an array of photoelectric receptors. LPP Fusion has achieved electron energies of 400 keV.Another line of fusion research using lasers also involves fusing hydrogen and boron-11 to produce helium nuclei, which continue the chain reaction from boron. One laser generates a powerful magnetic confinement field in a coil to trap the fusion reaction in a small area for a nanosecond, while a second more powerful laser triggers the nuclear fusion process. Early H-11B fusion trials at the Prague Asterix Laser System, using high-energy iodine lasers, have generated more energy than needed to trigger the fusion process.\\\\xa0in Australia develops this and is aiming to use non-thermal laser technology to fuse hydrogen and boron-11. A nanosecond laser pulse ignites a H-B fusion reaction, then a second laser and capacitive coil produce a kilotesla magnetic field to increase the reaction yield. This step is now the focus of research. The yield is increased further by a chain reaction to create helium nuclei which are captured in a charged sphere of at least two metres diameter to produce electricity directly, without any steam circuit. The 2.9 MeV alpha particles represent up to 300 kWh of energy per 15 mg H-11B fuel. A new project is developing fuel materials by synthesizing boron-11-enriched hydrogen borides and hydrogen-adsorbed boron nitride nanosheets. These will be tested at laser facilities overseas.The **Polywell** (\\\\\\'polyhedron\\\\\\' combined with \\\\\\'potential well\\\\\\')\\\\xa0device\\\\xa0consists of magnetic coils arranged in a polyhedral configuration of six sides, forming a cube. A cloud of electrons is confined in the middle of the device so as to be able to accelerate and confine the positive ions to be fused. This electrostatic confinement concept differs from traditional magnetic confinement because the fields do not need to confine ions\\\\xa0– only electrons.  has been researching the Polywell concept and looking at hydrogen and boron as fuel for aneutronic fusion. This followed some years of development by the US Navy, using deuterium fuel.**** is one of a number of private efforts to develop a commercial fusion power plant. The company’s magnetized target fusion (MTF) approach generates a compact toroid plasma in an injector, containing and compressing it using a magnetic field before injecting it into a spherical compression chamber. The chamber holds a liquid lead-lithium liner which is pumped to create a vortex, into which the plasma target is injected. A synchronized array of pistons firing simultaneously creates a spherical compression wave in the liquid metal, compressing the plasma target and heating it to fusion conditions. Founded in Canada in 2002, General Fusion is funded by a syndicate of private investors, energy venture capital companies, sovereign wealth funds and the Canadian government’s Sustainable Development Technology Canada (SDTC) fund. A further government grant was announced in October 2018, from the Strategic Innovation Fund. The company has demonstrated milestones including creating 200-300 eV magnetized spheromak plasmas and confining them for over 500 µs.Much of current work underway on MTF is derived from programmes at the Soviet Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy, under E. P. Velikhov, circa 1970. This inspired the LINUS project at the Naval Research Laboratory in the USA, and later the fast-liner project at Los Alamos.General Atomics has operated the  tokamak in San Diego for the US Department of Energy since the late 1980s. It aims to establish the scientific basis for optimizing the tokamak approach to fusion energy production.### Cold fusionIn March 1989, spectacular claims were made for another approach, when two researchers, in the USA (Stanley Pons) and the UK (Martin Fleischmann), claimed to have achieved fusion in a simple tabletop apparatus working at room temperature. \\\\\\'N-Fusion\\\\\\', or \\\\\\'cold fusion\\\\\\', involves the electrolysis of heavy water using palladium electrodes on which deuterium nuclei are said to concentrate at very high densities. The researchers claimed that heat – which could only be explained in terms of nuclear processes – was produced, as well as fusion byproducts, including helium, tritium and neutrons. Other experimenters failed to replicate this, however, and most of the scientific community no longer considers it a real phenomenon.### Low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR)Initiated by claims for ‘cold fusion’, research at the nanotechnology level is continuing on low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR) which apparently use weak nuclear interactions (rather than strong force as in nuclear fission or fusion) to create low-energy neutrons, followed by neutron capture processes resulting in isotopic change or transmutation, without the emission of strong prompt radiation. LENR experiments involve hydrogen or deuterium permeation through a catalytic layer and reaction with a metal. Researchers report that energy is released, though on any reproducible basis, very little more than is input. The main practical example is hydrogen plus nickel powder evidently giving more heat than can be explained on any chemical basis.The Japanese government is sponsoring LENR research\\\\xa0– notably a nano-metal hydrogen energy project (MHE)\\\\xa0– through its New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), and Mitsubishi is also active in research.\\\\xa0Over 2015-2019 Google funded 30 researchers on three projects and found no evidence that LENR is possible, but they made some advances in measurement and materials science techniques. There was some indication that the two projects involving palladium merited further study.Assessing fusion power----------------------The use of fusion power plants could substantially reduce the environmental impacts of increasing world electricity demands since, like nuclear fission power, they would not contribute to acid rain or the greenhouse effect. Fusion power could easily satisfy the energy needs associated with continued economic growth, given the ready availability of fuels. There would be no danger of a runaway fusion reaction as this is intrinsically impossible and any malfunction would result in a rapid shutdown of the plant.However, although fusion does not generate long-lived radioactive products and the unburned gases can be treated on site, there would a short- to medium-term radioactive waste problem due to activation of the structural materials. Some component materials will become radioactive during the lifetime of a reactor, due to bombardment with high-energy neutrons, and will eventually become radioactive waste. The volume of such waste would be similar to the corresponding volumes from fission reactors. However, the long-term radiotoxicity of the fusion wastes would be considerably lower than that from actinides in used fission fuel, and the activation product wastes would be handled in much the same way as those from fission reactors with some years of operation..There are also other concerns, principally regarding the possible release of tritium into the environment. It is radioactive and very difficult to contain since it can penetrate concrete, rubber and some grades of steel. As an isotope of hydrogen, it is easily incorporated into water, making the water itself weakly radioactive. With a half-life of about 12.3 years, the presence of tritium remains a threat to health for about 125 years after it is created, as a gas or in water, if at high levels. It can be inhaled, absorbed through the skin or ingested. Inhaled tritium spreads throughout the soft tissues and tritiated water mixes quickly with all the water in the body. Although there is only a small inventory of tritium in a fusion reactor – a few grams – each could conceivably release significant quantities of tritium during operation through routine leaks, assuming the best containment systems. An accident could release even more. This is one reason why long-term hopes are for the deuterium-deuterium fusion process, dispensing with tritium.While fusion power clearly has much to offer when the technology is eventually developed, the problems associated with it also need to be addressed if it is to become a widely used future energy source.* * *Notes & References------------------### Notesa. The nucleus of deuterium (D) consists of one proton and one neutron, whereas hydrogen only has one proton. Tritium (T) has one proton and two neutrons. When the nuclei of D and T fuse, helium-4 (two protons and two neutrons) is formed, along with a free neutron. The 17.6 MeV of energy released in the fusion reaction takes the form of kinetic energy, the helium having 3.5 MeV and the neutron 14.1 MeV. The products of the fusion reaction have a total mass that is slightly lower than the starting materials (D and T), this decrease in mass having been converted to energy according to E=mc2. ]b. Tritium can be produced by bombardment of lithium-6 with neutrons of any energy. When lithium-6 (three protons, three neutrons) absorbs a neutron it splits into helium (two protons, two neutrons) and tritium (one proton, two neutrons), along with the release of 4.8 MeV of energy. Tritium can also be produced from the more-abundant lithium-7 from high-energy neutrons. Hence, natural lithium can be used for tritium generation in a fusion reactor. According to the European Commission: \"A 1 GW (electric) fusion plant will need about 100 kg deuterium and 3 tons of natural lithium to operate for a whole year, generating about 7 billion kWh.\" ]c. The European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA) was established to provide a framework for magnetic confinement fusion research within the European Union and Switzerland. ]d. The Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory has a webpage on TFTR\\\\xa0]e. The first inertial confinement fusion experiments at NIF (see  will use the \\\\\\'indirect drive\\\\\\' method, which differs from the \\\\\\'direct drive\\\\\\' method described in the main text. In the indirect drive method, the lasers are focused on a gold cavity (known as a _hohlraum_) containing the fuel pellet. The lasers rapidly heat the inside surface of the hohlraum, generating X-rays that cause a blowoff of the capsule surface, in turn causing the fuel capsule to implode in the same way as if it had been hit with the lasers directly. It is hoped that NIF will be the first laser in which the energy released from the fusion fuel will exceed the laser energy used to produce the fusion reaction. ]f. Z machine was designed to supply X-ray pulses of 50 terawatts, but improvements allowed pulses of 290 terawatts.

(Image: A. Barber Huescar/IAEA)Newly released nuclear power data for 2023 collected by the IAEA, paint a picture of a clean energy technology at a crossroads amid the  to accelerate its deployment.Electricity production from nuclear power rose by 2.6 per cent last year compared to 2022, according to the operating data provided by IAEA Member States to the Power Reactor Information System (PRIS) — the IAEA’s comprehensive and publicly available database on nuclear power. Nuclear power continued to generate almost 10 percent of the world’s electricity and a quarter of all low carbon electricity last year, according to the data, which are featured in two newly released annual IAEA publications: Nuclear Power Reactors in the World () and Operating Experience with Nuclear Power Stations in Member States ().The USA remained the world’s top producer of nuclear electricity, followed by China and France. China continued to lead in newbuilds, beginning construction on five reactors. Newcomer Egypt started building its second reactor, according to the data, which showed the global fleet operating at nearly full strength with a median capacity factor of 88 per cent. While new grid connections were made at nuclear power plants in Belarus, China, Republic of Korea, Slovakia and the United States of America, reactors were shut down in Belgium, China and Germany.The 2023 data come against the backdrop of growing global ambitions for nuclear technology amid an aging reactor fleet. More than two-thirds of reactors are at least 30 years old. In December 2023, in the historic first Global Stocktake at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai, the 198 signatory countries to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change called for accelerating the deployment of low-emission energy technologies including nuclear power for deep and rapid decarbonization, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as industry. In addition, more than 20 countries at COP28 pledged to work towards tripling global nuclear power capacity to reach net zero by 2050.“IAEA data shows the global fleet of nuclear reactors continues to be a large and indispensable source of low-carbon electricity,” said IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi. “But it’s also clear that we will need to extend the lives of existing reactors, replace retiring facilities with new ones, and add a lot of new capacity so that global climate change and energy security goals can be reached.”]( Nuclear Power Development and Operating Experience Highlights------------------------------------------------------------------**Nuclear power status and trends**]( Taiwan, China - nuclear electricity produced:17.2 TWh, share of nuclear electricity produced: 6.9 per cent. Ukraine has not submitted 2023 data by the time of publication]( of the end of December 2023, global operational nuclear power capacity was 371.5 GW(e), provided by 413 reactors in 31 countries. However, only 403 reactors, with a combined capacity of 364.5 GW(e), reported their electricity production to the IAEA. Twenty-five reactors remained in suspended operations throughout the year, despite being licenced for operation. This includes four reactors in India with a combined net capacity of 639 MW(e) and 21 reactors in Japan with a combined net capacity of around 21 000 MW(e). Japan restarted two reactors in 2023, Takahama-1 and Takahama-2, which had been in suspended operation since 2011.Nuclear power capacity has remained at a consistent level over the past decade, with an additional 69.8 GW(e) nuclear capacity connected to the grid since the beginning of 2013. Over 79 per cent of this capacity growth occurred in Asia. China is still the fastest expanding nuclear power producer of the world, the reports on nuclear power reactors and operating experience show.China currently has 56 nuclear power reactors in operation and a further 27 reactors currently under construction.\\\\xa0Background----------The annual \\\\xa0 underscores the IAEA\\\\\\'s long-standing commitment as the custodian of the only officially collected and maintained data relating to nuclear power operating experience.

Small modular reactors (SMRs) — a cheaper, quicker-to-deploy alternative to the large nuclear power plants (LNPPs) that have traditionally dominated the sector — potentially offer a form of fossil fuel–free electricity that could help the world reach its emissions targets. However, a wide range of SMR designs exist or are in development — 68 are listed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) — and the lack of a dominant, proven model could curb commitments from utilities and investors.**Most SMR designs are being developed in the US, Russia, and China, but the sector is attracting companies from a large number of countries, even those with limited or no nuclear experience, such as Argentina and Poland. In a major signal of progress, Rolls-Royce was named in June 2025 as the preferred bidder by Great British Energy - Nuclear to build the UK’s first SMRs — a milestone that brings the promise of this technology closer to reality and underscores growing confidence in its commercial viability.An even wider range of nations is thinking about adopting SMR designs developed by other countries, with over 30 considering, planning, or starting new nuclear power programs, amid projections that meeting 2050 net zero targets may require up to 800 GW of new nuclear capacity — more than double what has been built over the last six decades.The designs gaining the most traction — along with the costs, regulatory conditions, and supply chains they will need to gain a solid foothold in the market — are summarized below and explored in full detail in the\\\\xa0.THE MAIN SMR DESIGNS--------------------SMRs are defined by the IAEA as having power capacity of up to 300 MWe, and broadly fall into two categories:1.  **Gen III/III+** — adaptations of existing LNPP designs that use light water as the coolant; they offer the market familiar, well-understood technology.\\\\xa0    2.  **Gen IV** — new designs that use different cooling sources, such as helium, molten salt, or molten metal (e.g., sodium and lead); these are untested technologies with limited to no operating experience.\\\\xa0    !!\\\\xa0SMR designs by typeThe coolants and fuels used in Gen IV reactors may enable them to operate at much higher temperatures than LNPPs without the need for significantly pressurized containment vessels. This would greatly improve safety — a key issue for nuclear power — and enable new industrial applications beyond low-emission power generation, including the production of green steel and ammonia.PROVING THE POTENTIAL OF SMRs-----------------------------A key advantage of SMRs is their modular, factory-based construction. Components are built using standardized processes, which cuts costs and deployment times compared with often bespoke LNPPs.However, to get SMRs into the market, the firms behind the technology need to prove that it is fit for purpose. While China and Russia have begun to produce power using SMRs, some promising projects elsewhere have faced setbacks. NuScale’s Idaho Falls project was cancelled in November 2023 due to growing concerns over cost overruns, construction delays, and a declining willingness among project stakeholders to bear the risks associated with FOAK development. This is because China and Russia have comparatively fewer regulatory hurdles, and Western utilities want to know that SMRs can work in jurisdictions with regulations and operating environments similar to their own before they commit.\\\\xa0We believe that only a handful of the currently active SMR designs will reach successful commercial deployment, but high uncertainty exists around which will prevail.

The Danish government’s work with the wind power sector provides a successful path — plans, tariffs, and R&D funding initiatives it put in place during the 1990s encouraged development of the industry, and wind power now produces 54% of Danish electricity, while the country boasts numerous world leaders in the sector.!!\\\\xa0Lessons for SMRs from comparable industriesThe costs SMRs will have to achieve to compete with other forms of baseload power will vary by country, with analysis showing the average cost of producing electricity over their lifetime needs to be between €52 €/MWh in Sweden and €119 €/MWh in Greece.For this to be attainable, SMRs and their components must be compatible with large-scale production to reach economies of scale. In terms of supply chains, SMR designs based on light water technology and that operate in a similar way to conventional reactors may have an advantage over Gen IV designs, as an extensive LNPP international supply chain already exists.However, while LNPPs are normally tailored to specific customer needs and local regulations, SMRs will rely on common, standardized components manufactured centrally and shipped to the construction site.

The outlook for the industry is being transformed by climate change policies, shifting energy priorities and technological advances. But delivery of a new generation of nuclear facilities could be compromised unless lessons are learned from past projects and the nuclear sector’s endemic cost and schedule overruns.The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts 2025 will mark an all-time high for nuclear power generation as output increases in France, Japanese plants start up again after the pause following the 2011 Fukushima disaster, and commercial reactors begin operations in many markets, including Europe, China, India, and Korea.[1] the US too new output is coming online. The first new-builds in 30 years – Vogtle 3 and 4 in Georgia – have entered commercial service. The Palisades plant in Michigan is scheduled to come back online this year after a $2 billion upgrade following its closure in 2022.[2] US and other governments are supporting this nuclear comeback to meet increased electricity demand and climate goals. Although the new Trump administration has already made moves to drop other low-carbon policy initiatives and funding, nuclear plant licences have been extended, and nuclear projects usually command bipartisan support.[3] (and in some American states), climate policies will drive nuclear expansion. Nuclear energy must make a growing contribution – alongside renewables – if the world is to decarbonize electricity generation. In December 2023, more than 20 countries from four continents at the COP28 climate action summit in Dubai signed a declaration to triple nuclear capacity to achieve global net zero by 2050.[4] European Union has given nuclear power the ‘green’ light for funding to promote sustainability.[5] transition to clean energy is also enabling China – which plans to double its nuclear capacity by 2030 – to reduce air pollution from coal-powered plants in major cities. Other Asian countries face similar challenges.As coal is phased out, wind and solar power have become a bigger source of energy, but renewable energy is intermittent in the absence of large-scale battery storage. Nuclear can provide a reliable baseload supply. Having nuclear in the mix can also protect a nation’s energy security. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine highlighted Europe’s dependence on imported fossil fuels.Meanwhile, the electrification of transport and other industries, and the expansion of data centres running power-hungry AI is stoking demand. In 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that electricity consumption by data centres, AI and the cryptocurrency sector could double by 2026. Electrification needs to accelerate rapidly on the IEA’s pathway for net zero by 2050. Electricity’s share in final energy consumption, which was up from 18% in 2015 to 20% in 2023, would approach 30% in 2030.[6] Tech as well as some other industrial users and governments are willing to pay a premium for secure, low-carbon power. In the US, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have struck high-value purchase agreements with nuclear generators. The energy will be supplied by a mixture of currently operating and recommissioned plants and a new generation of small modular reactors (SMRs).[7] 20-year contract (with Constellation, America’s largest nuclear operator) will help restart a mothballed reactor at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania. The facility is expected to produce 835 megawatts of power to offset Microsoft’s data centre electricity needs.[8] and Google are also investing in start-ups developing SMRs,[9]\\\\xa0… Continue reading while Meta has released requests for proposals from providers of 1-4 gigawatts of nuclear generation capacity to power data centres needed for AI.### **SMRs – small, modular and repeatable?**With outputs up to 300 megawatts, SMRs promise a more flexible and affordable nuclear option for supplanting fossil fuel power stations. Conventional larger-scale nuclear reactors can be challenged by their upfront capital costs and construction timelines. Some are projecting that building SMRs could take less than half the construction time for large reactors.[10] Manufacturing modules in controlled factory settings may increase efficiency and assure quality. Modular designs also allow capacity to be increased incrementally, further reducing financing risk.Apart from American SMR-powered nuclear submarines, the first SMR units are already operating in China and Russia. As with solar and wind technology, China gained an advantage on the West in SMR nuclear technology, while Russia leads in SMR fuel production. The US government and companies have been investing in SMR technology to catch up.[11] countries – including Canada and the UK – are also backing SMR technology and its export potential.[12] Some years away from commercial scale, there are said to be more than 80 SMR designs using diverse technologies at different stages of development globally.[13] Demonstration projects later this decade could pave the way for a rollout of commercial SMR fleets beginning in the 2030s.[14] of SMRs believe that their smaller scale and simpler designs should allow standardization and cost-effective manufacturing and assembly. This product-based approach – modelled on ‘shipyard’ production – could improve cost and schedule performance.[15]### The case for caution in nuclear constructionOur global experience of major nuclear engineering and construction projects – and other sectors (including shipbuilding) – teaches caution.Early SMRs will be first-of-a-kind projects with the associated risks and uncertainties that entails. In 2023 the first planned SMR in the US was cancelled due to rising construction costs and an electricity price uncompetitive with wind and solar.[16] Costs and delays could arise as the industry adapts to new designs and processes. This may also apply to the new generation of ‘advanced nuclear reactors’ using futuristic technologies (that some SMRs may leverage), such as molten salt, high-temperature gas cooling and sodium cooling, and travelling wave designs.[17] shorter SMR construction schedules do not guarantee programme certainty. Building a downsized reactor is still a complex capital project. Units should be easier to deploy – on brownfield sites of retired coal-fired plants, for example, or off-grid to provide power or heat to industry. Every location has unique features that can challenge contractors, however., which analyses the incidence and causes of claims and disputes, confirms the comparatively poor record of nuclear projects. Over the seven-year timeframe to 2024, disputed costs averaged 62.8% of budgeted capital expenditure on 27 nuclear projects in seven countries. This was notably higher than for power stations fuelled by fossil fuels (74 projects in total, in 32 countries), which faced overruns of 40.7%.![]( extensions of time claimed by contractors were highest on European nuclear projects – averaging 74% of planned schedules, and three times longer than in the Middle East (the region with the longest overruns for all infrastructure and capital projects).[18]CRUX data for time extensions on US nuclear projects is not cited here as it includes claims for the additional costs of storing spent nuclear due to breach of contract over the federal\\\\xa0… Continue readingResultant distress may be higher, but most of the main causes of claims and disputes on nuclear projects are shared with other types of construction projects. Change in scope, the primary and near-universal driver of conflict in construction, was nearly twice as likely to affect nuclear projects (34.5%) as fossil power stations.Another, related cause was late design information (24.1%). Immature designs not only make conflicts and delays during construction more likely, they also make it difficult to verify cost estimates and schedules. Optimism bias is by no means unique to the nuclear sector, but unrealistic budgets and schedules and the significant overruns that result can derail projects.[19]National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2023. Laying the Foundation for New and Advanced Nuclear Reactors in the United States.  ### Learning the lessons of past failuresCosts have ballooned on EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) contracts for nuclear plant projects around the world. This has often arisen from the civil (non-nuclear) construction element, according to a 2023 US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report on new nuclear construction.[20]National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2023. Laying the Foundation for New and Advanced Nuclear Reactors in the United States. Global in scope, the report also noted that past studies had cited ‘negative learning for nuclear.’It is no surprise that most recurrent causes of conflict across the CRUX database of 2,000 projects are also prominent in the nuclear sector. Poor management of subcontractors and their interfaces affected almost one in four nuclear projects (24.1%); and clashes over contract interpretation even more (27.6%).Alleged bias or failure to cooperate was far more common in nuclear (17.2%) than fossil power (2.9%) projects, perhaps reflecting a greater cultural diversity of project partners, if not sheer complexity.Part of that complexity arises from the regulatory requirements around nuclear safety. CRUX indicates that nuclear projects were more likely to be affected by late approvals than fossil fuel power stations (20.7% vs. 8.8%) or all non-nuclear power projects(16.5%). Such delays may be due to the procedures of either/both employers and regulators. Inadequate responses to information requests were also notably more common in the nuclear sector than in the power sector as a whole (20.7% vs. 8.1%). However, poor interface management with third parties was blamed for disputes on a slightly smaller proportion of nuclear than non-nuclear power projects (10.3% vs. 13.2%).Some argue skills shortages are to be expected in an industry that has been stagnant for many years. The IEA identified investment in human capital as a priority for countries committing to nuclear growth. Utilities have generally not retained the staff needed to execute large nuclear projects. Many megaproject owners rely on outsourced technical expertise, and lack the capacity to oversee projects (which is not unique to the nuclear industry).[21]National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2023. Laying the Foundation for New and Advanced Nuclear Reactors in the United States. Much of the global construction industry suffers from skills gaps and problems with workmanship. The US, for example, has a shortfall in mechanical and electrical engineering talent, as well as critical trades such as welding.![]( More proactive reactor constructionAs much as $1.5 trillion could be invested in the nuclear renaissance through to 2050,[22] but the scale and unpredictability of construction costs remain a major obstacle. Citing past cost and schedule overruns, an investment analysis of the European nuclear market calls for new frameworks to mitigate the construction risks and attract capital.[23] CRUX research and some of the other evidence explored here point to some essential guardrails for new-build nuclear projects.At the outset, challenge sessions and war gaming can help crystallize the risks and choices for investors, promoters and other stakeholders. Independent checks of cost estimates and schedules by industry experts can mitigate optimism bias. The earlier the design is completed on a project, the fewer associated delays are likely to be encountered, and the greater chance the project will be delivered on time and budget.A proactive approach by project employers and fairly balanced allocation of risks among the parties will improve risk management and foster more productive working relationships with EPC contractors. Intelligent use of BIM (building information modelling) can enhance coordination and construction management. The potential benefits over the life cycle of both the project and operations may justify the creation of digital twins. During construction, comprehensive risk registers and robust project controls remain essential to keep projects on track.Notwithstanding new funding models, most nuclear projects worldwide rely on some level of government support – not only financial, but also to address skills shortages and regulatory risk. In the US, for example, the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act recognised the need to fund the training of a new generation of nuclear engineers and fill gaps in other project-critical professions and trades.Meanwhile, project teams can tailor design processes to align with regulation so that approvals overlap with design progress to minimise hold-ups. The ability to replicate proven SMRs should ease this regulatory burden. International efforts to streamline and harmonise design certification are also encouraging.[24] the project level, a proactive approach to engineering and construction will be needed to mitigate risk and avoid past pitfalls, enabling cost-effective delivery of the nuclear renaissance.### About the authorKim Reome is a specialist in damages analysis in the construction and electric utility industries with over 30 years’ experience.

(Photo: D. Calma/IAEA)There is growing global interest in nuclear energy, and countries are acting on this interest. In the opening session of the Scientific Forum, the President of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo, shared his plans for the inclusion of nuclear energy in the country’s electricity generation mix. “We’re committed to a clean, equitable energy transition that harnesses the full potential of all low carbon sources, including nuclear power,” President Akufo-Addo said. “Nuclear power will play a significant part in this transformation.”\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Ghana is analysing small modular reactors (SMRs) and their potential for rapid deployment for clean and affordable energy. “We are working with industry experts to study the feasibility of deploying this new technology in Ghana,” President Akufo-Addo said.\\\\xa0In the United States of America, where nuclear power provides the single largest source of clean energy, “reaching our 2050 net zero goals depends on at least tripling our nuclear energy capacity to 300 gigawatts or more,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm. The US Government has invested “billions of dollars in the future of nuclear energy, creating historic tax incentives for investments in new facilities and production of nuclear energy,” and the development of a domestic fuel supply chain is underway, she added\\\\xa0\\\\xa0The US Department of Energy recently released , a set of reports to accelerate the deployment of clean energy technologies, including advanced nuclear reactors. Advanced reactors are key to reaching net zero goals because they can help to decarbonize energy intensive industries, such as hydrogen production, desalination, district heating, petroleum refining and fertilizer production, Secretary Granholm said. She encouraged more countries to look at nuclear energy as a sustainable, long term investment and to harness “the power of the atom for a new era of peace and prosperity in what is potentially the greatest peace project of our time – a net zero world.”\\\\xa0The Republic of Korea is also investing in growing its nuclear sector. Since 2000, Korea has been implementing its Nuclear Power System Development Plan, with a specific focus on developing advanced reactors, and as a result, in 2012, Korea’s first SMR – SMART – received the standard design approval from the Korean regulator, said Lee Jong-Ho, Minister of Science and ICT in the Republic of Korea. “Now we are developing an even more advanced and innovative SMR based on SMART technology,” he added.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0The Korean Government believes that the private sector should take the lead in technological innovations. “This is especially true for the SMR sector, which aims to replace fossil fuels in industries such as seawater desalination and space exploration,” Minister Jong-Ho said. The Korean Government is launching the Korea SMR Initiative to transfer SMART and other advanced nuclear technologies to the private sector in order to help demonstrate and commercialize new reactors. “To kick start these efforts, starting next year, the Government will collaborate with the relevant companies to invest in developing high temperature gas reactors designed for industrial process heat with applications such as hydrogen production and other uses,” he said.\\\\xa0In Morocco, the Government is considering adding nuclear power to its energy mix to ensure a reliable energy supply. “Morocco places a distinct focus on small modular reactors due to their numerous advantages, including the flexibility for integration,” said Leila Benali, Morocco’s Minister of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development, in a video statement to the Forum. “They hold significant promise for diverse applications, such as combined heat and power generation and seawater desalination.”\\\\xa0Minister Benali also announced that Morocco’s National Centre for Nuclear Energy, Sciences and Technology has been designated as an , enabling it to function as a global learning platform. “Morocco\\\\\\'s national infrastructure that is now reinforced by this recognition is open for the benefit of the African continent with a focus on capacity building,” she said.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0For the past 40 years, Sweden has expanded different forms of renewable energy, with wind power providing a significant share of electricity, and biomass replacing oil and coal for district heating and industrial processes. “What was forgotten, though, was that the power system is very sensitive and that it has to work technically. It\\\\\\'s not just about adding terawatt hours,” said Sweden’s Vice Minister for Climate and the Environment, Daniel Westlén. Considering the requirement for dispatchable energy to meet demand, when and where needed, as well as for demand to be met without carbon emissions, the options are limited. “Nuclear energy is the only option available,” he added.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0To reach climate and net zero goals, studies have estimated a doubling or tripling of nuclear energy capacity by 2050. “Can the world build 20 or even 40 gigawatts of nuclear energy per year? I would claim it is possible. We’ve done it before,” Vice Minister Westlén said. In the 1980s, more than 180 reactors were under construction globally, and more than 30 gigawatts were added in one single year, he explained. Sweden deployed 12 large reactors between 1972 and 1985. While “climate change is the greatest challenge humanity has ever faced… we are in possession of the tools that we will need to solve this,” he concluded.\\\\xa0Last year, French President Emmanuel Macron announced a programme to build six nuclear reactors, as well as a programme dedicated to nuclear and innovation with small and advanced modular reactors. “We need energy, which is at the same time cheap, affordable and sustainable. And that\\\\\\'s not so easy to solve,” said François Jacq, General Administrator of the French Atomic Energy Commission. “That\\\\\\'s why we need innovation.” Innovation will come in many forms – in applications, approaches and technologies – and will also attract the future generation to the nuclear field.\\\\xa0“We will also have to innovate in the field of cooperation, in partnership. We have to invent new forms of cooperation. We have to invent new forms of research and technology organization,” General Administrator Jacq said.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0![]( energy influencer, Isabelle Boemeke, provided the keynote address at the opening session of the\\\\xa0Scientific Forum, Nuclear Innovations for Net Zero, at the IAEA 67th General Conference in Vienna, Austria, 26 September 2023. (Photo: D. Calma/IAEA)Wrapping up the opening session, Brazilian-born nuclear energy influencer Isabelle Boemeke, reflected on the power of social media to inform young audiences. “Social media can sound superficial, but the reality is that\\\\\\'s how young people learn about the world,” said Boemeke, also known as . “They trust influencers’ opinions on products, health tips and ideas. And while we\\\\\\'ve seen social media being used for bad, I believe we can leverage these tools and actually use it for good.”\\\\xa0She brought attention to the value of leaders in listening and engaging with young generations. “Young people are very much open to it, and they\\\\\\'re waiting to hear from people, like yourselves, that it\\\\\\'s OK to support this technology. Getting the population informed on all the benefits grants license to our leaders to pursue realistic decarbonization paths\\\\xa0– paths that very boldly include nuclear power at the heart,” Boemke said. Encouraging the audience of decision makers to be courageous, she concluded by asking, “Are you leaders or followers?”\\\\xa0Read  in the latest \\\\xa0![]( Scientific Forum featured a panel of young professionals in the nuclear field. They discussed their motivation to pursue a career in nuclear and the importance of diversity and inclusion. (Photo: H. Shaffer/IAEA)The Forum included a segment on youth, featuring a panel of young professionals in the nuclear field: Benjamin Bertaux, Junior Decommissioning Expert at the IAEA; Loretta Boahemaa Manu, Associate Transport Safety Officer at the IAEA; Yvonne Lin, Nuclear Engineering Intern at the IAEA; and Grace Stanke, nuclear energy advocate and current-Miss America. They expressed how \"cool\" and attractive the nuclear field is for new generations and the importance of creating collaborative research projects with universities to expose students to various career paths. Insisting on the importance of promoting diversity and inclusion in the nuclear industry, the panel shared that to attract new talent, it is as much about the science as it is about storytelling and innovative ways to communicate about nuclear.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Boahemaa Manu and Lin are both fellows of the , which is open for applicants until 30 September.\\\\xa0The way forward---------------From China to the United Kingdom and beyond, countries around the world have ambitious plans to expand their nuclear fleets. By 2035, China expects to build 150 new nuclear reactors. “We have so many coal-fired power stations that must be replaced by nuclear power,” said Yu Jianfeng,\\\\u202fChairman of China National Nuclear Corporation, during the closing session of the Forum on Wednesday.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0In the United Kingdom, “we have an ambitious target of 24 gigawatts of nuclear power to be on the UK grid by 2050,” said Andrew Bowie, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State and Minister for Nuclear and Networks. “As vital as it is to decarbonize our energy baseload, it is also about prices – the cost of living, affordable energy, and being energy secure and independent.”\\\\xa0\\\\xa0When it comes to prices, Finland’s Minister of Climate and Environment, Kai Mykkänen, told the Forum that Finland’s Olkiluoto 3, Europe’s largest nuclear reactor at 1.6 gigawatts, has led to the lowest electricity prices in Finland in years. Olkiluoto 3, which began regular output in April, is the key reason Finland has ceased direct electricity and natural gas imports, while simultaneously lowering electricity prices, he said.\\\\xa0Public acceptance, as well as financing, surrounding nuclear power must also be considered in the path forward. “We have to interact with society to ensure the technical solutions we propose will be, in the end, accepted,” said Peter Baeten, Director General of the Belgian Nuclear Research Center SCK CEN. Furthermore, while technical innovation is essential, there are other aspects of innovation, said Sama Bilbao,\\\\u202fDirector General of World Nuclear Association. “We need innovation in the way we finance new nuclear. We need to think outside the box to attract investment into these nuclear projects,” she added.\\\\xa0Given the speed and scale of innovation within the nuclear field, Director General Grossi is optimistic. “There are challenges, but it is clear – we are moving decisively. We are moving, perhaps, at different paces and in different ways,” he said. “The end result will not be uniform because there is not a one-size-fits-all solution. But we can see how nuclear is very firmly positioned in this global effort that is taking place now.”\\\\xa0\\\\xa0![]( closing session of the Scientific Forum at the IAEA 67th General Conference held at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, Austria, 27 September 2023.

Small modular reactors increase flexibility in capacity thanks to integrated energy systems. Fast reactors, thorium reactors and other new technologies can provide novel fuel cycle solutions. The first session focussed on new reactor concepts that have already been implemented and present visionary outlooks for future developments. It showcased how innovative ideas for small and large reactors will shape our energy future.\\\\xa0**Session 2: Innovative Solutions to Support Nuclear Development**\\\\xa0(.)The prospects for nuclear power depend not only on innovations in reactor technologies but also in manufacturing processes, the security of fuel supply, spent fuel solutions and other factors. There are already examples of how innovations, such as artificial intelligence and additive manufacturing, are paving the way for safe and sustainable solutions that could support cost savings and improve the economics of operating nuclear power plants. The second session explored how innovative solutions — from front end to back end — will enable extended prospects of nuclear power. It highlighted innovations that have already been implemented and present outlooks for future solutions that will support NPP design and operation, fuel cycle and end of life activities.\\\\xa0**Session 3: Nuclear Power Going Beyond Electricity Production**\\\\xa0(.)Today, high-emitting fossil fuels power most industrial processes, transport and building heating systems. The expanded use of nuclear power for industrial purposes, including district heating, desalination and industrial processes in remote locations, and deployment models such as floating nuclear power plants, offer options to reduce emissions and increase the security of supply of the global energy system. The third session showcased how nuclear technology can be used to avoid greenhouse gases in new applications.\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Related stories---------------]( Energy for Climate Change Mitigation to Benefit Several Countries, New Studies Show]( Explained – Nuclear Energy for Net Zero]( Chief at COP27: Nuclear is Part of Climate Crisis Solution]( Perceptions of Nuclear Energy]( are Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)?]( Showcases Progress in Nuclear Harmonization and Standardization Initiative to Facilitate Deployment of SMRs]( resources-----------------*       *       *       *       *       *       *       *       Sep282023#### More on the IAEA1.      2.      3.      #### Scientific resources1.      2.      3.      4.      #### Resources1.      2.      3.      #### Documents1.      2.      3.      4.      #### Stay in touch[]( \"Facebook\")[]( \"Twitter\")[]( \"Instagram\")[]( \"YouTube\")[]( \"LinkedIn\")[]( \"Flickr\")[]( \"Spotify\")[]( \"Apple Podcast\")[]( \"Google Podcast\")[]( \"RSS Feeds\")[]( \"Contact IAEA\")[]( \"Facebook\")[]( \"Twitter\")[]( \"Instagram\")[]( \"YouTube\")[]( \"LinkedIn\")[]( \"Flickr\")[]( \"Spotify\")[]( \"Apple Podcast\")[]( \"Google Podcast\")[]( \"RSS Feeds\")[]( \"Contact IAEA\")#### Newsletter Subscribe[](\\'}]', name='web_search_tool', call_id='call_0k4Cg7Mk9ysrAcQHCX5fsYAP', is_error=False)]), TextMessage(id='e4a9c051-4de3-4245-b359-8954ccf6dfa1', source='research_enhancer', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=34080, completion_tokens=10), metadata={}, created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 8, 7, 20, 9, 24, 862044, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), content='The research is sufficient to proceed with the report.', type='TextMessage'), TextMessage(id='6d117896-5650-4434-85ff-54c903e5d1bf', source='research_analyst', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=34110, completion_tokens=718), metadata={}, created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 8, 7, 20, 9, 41, 453902, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), content='# Comprehensive Report on New Developments in Nuclear Energy\\n\\n## Executive Summary\\nThe nuclear energy sector is witnessing a renaissance as nations prioritize decarbonization and seek reliable energy sources.

The key findings from recent research indicate significant advancements in nuclear reactor technologies, especially Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and nuclear fusion initiatives. Furthermore, emerging policies and an increasing public focus on sustainability highlight the vital role of nuclear energy in achieving global net-zero targets by 2050. \\\\n\\\\n## Background & Current State\\\\nIn 2023, global electricity production from nuclear energy increased by 2.6%, and it now accounts for nearly 10% of the world\\'s electricity generation and 25% of its low-carbon electricity production. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reports a considerable investment in new reactors, particularly in countries like China, the US, and France. A significant portion of the existing nuclear fleet is aging, with over two-thirds of reactors being over 30 years old, necessitating investments in new technologies and facilities.\\\\n\\\\nSome noteworthy events include the opening of Vogtle Unit 3 in Georgia, the first new reactor to go online in nearly a decade, and progress on advanced reactor designs such as those proposed by NuScale and Kairos Power in the United States. These developments are critical as countries aim to triple global nuclear capacity to meet climate commitments.\\\\n\\\\n## Analysis & Insights\\\\nThe main trends in nuclear energy development include:\\\\n1. **Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)**: These offer cheaper and quicker deployment options compared to traditional large nuclear plants.
